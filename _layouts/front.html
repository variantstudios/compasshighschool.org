                advances in our society we continue to push ourselves out of nature in a way that prevents us from making deep connections with the earth and with ourselves. <a href="#">More</a></p>

            <p>They didn’t quite fit into the institutional box, and more importantly, they didn’t try to fit you into any box. Compass is a school designed by those teachers. Compass is a school full of those teachers, surrounded and supported by a community
                of mentors from business, nonprofit and higher education organizations. That exceptional, life-changing learning experience you had isn’t the exception at Compass; it’s the rule.</p>
