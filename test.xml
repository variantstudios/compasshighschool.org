             <title>How to Get Your Mind to Read</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/26willingham-superjumbo---x----1821-1821x---.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image by Lilli Carré&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent NYT article reinforces why an integrated academic curriculum such as the community-engaged, project-based curriculum at Compass (CCC) is needed in today’s world.  While we are not alone in this desire, we want to make literacy part of ALL venture projects and coursework at CCC.  All ventures will be highly dependent on thoughtful communication including writing and speaking skills.  This provides the basis for development of one of the core Compass Competencies, Communication and Foundational Literacy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this so important in today’s educational system?  Check out the NYT’s article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/opinion/sunday/how-to-get-your-mind-to-read.html&quot;&gt;How to Get Your Mind to Read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Why Compass? A Conversation</title>
             <description>&lt;div id=&quot;a-parents-conversation-with-compass-founder-jan-harrison&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/charles-deluvio-456505---x----2908-980x---.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;A Parent&amp;rsquo;s Conversation with Compass founder Jan Harrison -- by Brian Cooke&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agreeing to send your child to a brand new school is a daunting prospect, and it raises all sorts of questions. As a parent who&amp;rsquo;s considering sending my daughter to Compass next year, I sat down with Compass founder Jan Harrison this week and asked her a few questions. We talked about the school, the philosophies behind it, and some practical, brick-and-mortar type questions. Here are a few of my questions, along with Jan&amp;rsquo;s answers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi Jan. So what’s Compass Community Collaborative School all about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan Harrison: At Compass, we’re going to have a school culture that supports kids in an environment of student-centered accomplishment. Our students will be explicitly taught the skills they need to try harder, to get more out of their education, and to build the confidence and skills they’ll need to succeed in life. We want them to thrive as adolescents, as high school graduates on college campuses, and in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the “Collaborative” part of the school’s name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH: Collaboration is a key part of our approach and it starts with the classroom environment. Students will work together as teams under the guidance of their teachers, who we’re hiring for a spirit of entrepreneurship and collaboration. For example, an English teacher and a science teacher might work together with students and community partners on a climate change project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of the collaborative approach is that it’s social, which is really important in keeping students engaged. Collaboration can also provide practical experience. One major example of that is with our internships. To accomplish their own academic and professional goals, each student will design and complete at least one semester-long internship — usually with a local company or organization — before they graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also collaborating through &lt;a href=&quot;https://compassfortcollins.org/community-partners/&quot;&gt;community partnerships&lt;/a&gt; with CSU, Front Range Community College and other organizations. Our school library is going to be CSU’s Morgan Library and the Poudre River Library District, and we’ll be part of programs like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csuwritingproject.net/&quot;&gt;CSU Writing Project&lt;/a&gt;, which is led by a CSU English professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a charter school and how does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH: Here in Colorado, charter schools are public schools that are authorized by a local school district or a state school district called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csi.state.co.us/&quot;&gt;Colorado Charter School Institute&lt;/a&gt;. They’re like all other public school in terms of things like funding, accountability and educational standards, but they’re allowed to have different rules for things like busing, food, hiring and clothing policies. Charter schools are a way for public schools to innovate techniques that could eventually be used by other public schools. Like any public school, charter schools are free but there are fees that can come up. In a given year at Compass there might be $300 in fees for technology and trips. These can be waived for qualifying families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Compass graduates be as prepared for standardized achievement tests as students that go to regular PSD schools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH: We will cover state standards, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.summitlearning.org/program/online-platform&quot;&gt;Summit Learning Platform&lt;/a&gt; will be our open source curriculum, including exams. Our students may be better prepared for standardized tests because our students are not only learning specific subjects but also applying their academic knowledge in projects and internships and actually teaching subjects by being mentors to younger students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you tell me about your teachers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH: We have some highly experienced teachers who know that this approach works and are passionate about empowering students. Our teachers are all certified — that is, they’ve completed a teacher education program and passed content-area tests for the state. We believe in the public teaching profession and we want to support it. That’s one thing about charter schools that often concerns parents, because Colorado charter schools aren’t required to hire certified teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know that this kind of school works?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH: A lot of schools are moving to this kind of competency-based, student-centered style of education. Some established schools with similar approaches are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hightechhigh.org/&quot;&gt;High-Tech High&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.summitps.org/&quot;&gt;Summit Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;Big Picture Learning&quot;&gt;Big Picture Learnin&lt;/a&gt;g. Students are graduating successfully from these schools and they’re succeeding at higher rates than other high school graduates: things like having a career path, knowing what they want to major in, and graduating from college in four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if my child has an IEP, a 504 plan or special needs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be able to handle children with mild special needs, along with their IEPs or 504 plans. We’ll also work with students that have English language learning needs and we’ll have a special education specialist on staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you on track for opening next August?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH: We’re on track. We have 131 students enrolled of the 160 we need to have by January 19. We’re working hard to get a physical location, which will hopefully be along the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ridetransfort.com/max&quot;&gt;Max bus line&lt;/a&gt; for access to CSU and many of our other community partners. We’re working with an architect to design a space that suits our needs and we’re expecting to sign a lease in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Jan. How do I get more information about the school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JH: The main resource is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://compassfortcollins.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. There are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://compassfortcollins.org/parents/&quot;&gt;parent information meetings&lt;/a&gt; and you can always &lt;a href=&quot;https://compassfortcollins.org/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; with specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Our Charter is Approved!</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/fullsizeoutput-fc-1---x----3367-1853x---.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night (November 14th) was a big night for Compass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending the better part of the past two years designing a school model, building a curriculum and doing all of the dirty work of writing and defending our charter application (hundreds of man-hours), the Poudre School District School Board approved our charter with a vote of 7-0.  There are a few contingencies (which we expected) but all involved feel great about meeting these standards going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSD staff, leadership and school board put in countless hours reviewing our work, giving us needed feedback and challenging us with thoughtful questions.  It is evident that the district and school board are invested in us and want to see us succeed.  As stated by members of the School Board and the Compass team, we really look forward to continuing our relationship and using our partnership to innovate and learn together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the School Board, PSD staff, PSD Leadership, Compass families and volunteers (too numerous to name), supportive community members and business owners who have partnered with us, CSU and, most importantly, the students who have supported us and invested in us.  We can’t wait to get started.  We’ve put in a lot of work but the fun begins in August.  &lt;/p&gt;

             <title>November Community Gathering</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/fullsizeoutput-2---x----4032-2049x---.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, November 6th, at the Fort Collins Music District, Compass held a community gathering of enrolled students, parents, family members and members of the Compass design team and Governing Board members.  It was an incredible opportunity for families to ask questions of the Compass team, share thoughts and ideas for the school opening and for students to engage in Compass-style learning.  Over 30 prospective students worked with staff members to explore design and creative thinking and they came away really excited about what school could look like.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Q/A was thoughtful and too short (we had so many good questions, we didn’t get to all of them).  We answered questions about everything from our leadership and staff qualifications to our curriculum model.  We provided examples of student projects for different levels of students, discussed our fundraising (we just got a $1 million dollar donation!), and began the work of getting our families involved in our school design.  It was an amazing night and we look forward to doing it again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll announce other events soon.  Come back to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>My Spirit Animal</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/fullsizeoutput-1---x----4012-2063x---.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As we get closer to our opening, we will be sharing &lt;strong&gt;Project Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;, examples of projects that we will be working on with students at Compass.  Keeping in mind that student voice is an important element in any project, these proposals will be a framework of projects with the potential to evolve as student interest and voice are integrated into our curriculum. However, these are meant as examples to illustrate a primary component of students’ learning at Compass.  These overviews include topic, description and curriculum connections.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Topic:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; My Spirit Animal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your &lt;em&gt;spirit animal&lt;/em&gt;?  Is it a camel; calm, slow and thoughtful? Is it a howler monkey; loud, energetic and spontaneous.  The desire to share who we are with others by referencing the world around us is not new.  It is what has driven much of what we recognize as visual art, poetry and fashion. This use of familiar entities helps us to connect with others, find commonalities and share our values, feelings, ideas and beliefs with those around us and has been a common practice for centuries. In the age of the internet, the concept of a “Spirit Animal” has become a fun social exploration where people choose an animal that represents who they really are. It helps us relate.  It helps us find out what we have in common and, sometimes, what makes us unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept is what drives the &lt;strong&gt;Spirit Animal&lt;/strong&gt; project.  As students enter Compass, one of the most important aspects we focus on is individual identity.  What makes each of us unique? interesting? brilliant? What connections and common ground can we find as a community?  How can we utilize our differences to strengthen our school?  These questions can’t be answered until students better know themselves.  This is one of the primary purposes of this project.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final products may include sculpted mounted animal heads covered in student writing and pictures that illustrate personal characteristics of both the animal species and the individual student.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As students learn about themselves, they will be asked to consider their own environment, just as animals must consider theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The Three Components of Curriculum at Compass:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Content, Concepts, Competencies)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content Connections:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science: &lt;/strong&gt;Ecosystems, ecological niche, biomes, ecological relationships, food webs/chains&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading, Writing and Communicating: &lt;/strong&gt;creative writing and composition; technical writing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arts:&lt;/strong&gt; sculpture; paper mache; photography&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contemporary Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific issues associated with chosen animals&lt;br /&gt;- ex: Poaching, population growth, overfishing, habitat destruction, cultural significance &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curricular Concepts:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Identity&lt;br /&gt;- Relationships&lt;br /&gt;- Systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compass Competencies:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Information and Media Literacy;&lt;br /&gt;- Communication and Foundational Literacies;&lt;br /&gt;- Curiosity, Imagination, and Creativity&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>We've Defended.</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/COMPASS-HIGH-SCHOOL-LOGOS-colors2-2---x----630-148x---.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 24th, the Compass Community Collaborative School Team formally defended our Charter application to the Poudre School District School Board.  From the day we turned in our application in mid-August to now, it has been an extremely busy time for our team, families and those in PSD that have helped us get to this point.  So, clearly, we have several &lt;em&gt;Thank You’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;PSD School Board&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for taking the time to read our application, make copious notes and ask tough, challenging questions.  We recognize that our success is amplified by being pushed and challenged.  We so appreciate your thoughtful and thorough questioning of our work so far.  We would expect nothing less when the common goal is to support and educate the youth of Fort Collins.  We can only grow and learn through experiences like this.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;Poudre School District Administration, leadership and charter application review team&lt;/strong&gt; for thoughtfully considering our work and application, giving us important feedback, challenging us in our thinking and assisting us in working through the crazy challenges of trying to open a new school (budget, facilities, curriculum, student support, programming, etc.).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;students and their families,&lt;/strong&gt; for supporting us from the beginning, investing in our model, giving us important perspectives on our development and enrolling in our school before it actually exists.  Thanks for believing in us.  We will continue to do everything we can to make you proud.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;​the &lt;em&gt;(too numerous to mention by name) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fort Collins community organizations and businesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that have partnered with us to support our students (yes, we already have students working in the community), our staff and our mission in bringing continued educational innovation to our city.  From working with interns, supporting us through monetary and in-kind donations, partnering with us on future programming and sharing your expertise and knowledge as we continue to grow and develop.  We are a Community Collaborative.  We are only as strong as our community.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colorado State University and the numerous departments, faculty and leaders&lt;/strong&gt;that have helped us grow our partnership.  From dedicated space on campus that we will utilize daily once our school opens to helping us drive our recent summer prototype, we recognize the importance of your support in helping students see higher education as both accessible and achievable, now and in the future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayor Wade Troxell and the City of Fort Collins &lt;/strong&gt;for sharing your vision of innovation with us, your support for our work and your willingness to work with us in a variety of future endeavors.  We look forward to years of collaboration and growth as a City of Invention.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;many local individuals and families&lt;/strong&gt; that came to the School Board meeting and sat (and stood) for many hours to show their support for our work.  Although not everyone could stay the five hours that we engaged and discussed our school model with PSD, we can’t thank you enough for giving up an evening with your families to demonstrate to PSD the community interest and passion for our school.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, and most importantly, the &lt;strong&gt;STUDENTS&lt;/strong&gt; that have provided their voice in the design of our school over the past 2 years.  Their voice has been the most important from the beginning in the form of our initial focus group with Fort Collins students to share their thoughts on what they want for future middle and high school students, the summer pilot students (age 13-18) that gave up two weeks in the summer to explore and learn together on CSU’s campus and the members of our Executive Design Team and Founding Board.  And, finally, to the students that have actively voiced their passion and drive for our school to local organizations, the PSD Administration and the PSD School Board, we never could have reached this point without you.  You are an inspiration for all of us.  As we work to grow young adults that can lead us in the future, you give us a model for what passion and purpose can look like in our youth.  You have no idea how much each of you will change the world and the City of Fort Collins.  &lt;em&gt;You already have. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As we get closer to our opening, we will be sharing &lt;strong&gt;Project Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;, examples of projects that we will be working on with students at Compass.  Keeping in mind that student voice is an important element in any project, these proposals will be a framework of projects with the potential to evolve as student interest and voice are integrated into our curriculum. However, these are meant as examples to illustrate a primary component of students’ learning at Compass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Topic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Power and Myths of Storytelling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compass Competencies:&lt;/strong&gt;* Information and Media Literacy; Communication and Foundational Literacies*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the film “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance”(1962) Jimmy Stewart plays a man, Rance, who is given credit for shooting the notorious criminal, Liberty Valance.  As a result, his character goes on to become famous for the act.  In fact, John Wayne’s character, Tom, was the one who actually shot Valance but he let’s Rance take credit.  In the film, when Rance tries to tell a reporter the truth, he responds with the famous quote: “When the legend becomes fact… print the legend”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson is that pop culture and the telling of stories has a way of creating legends that over time can become unquestionable truth.  Of course, this lesson is extremely important in today’s world of social media and questionable news sources. The desire of many to use these tools to tell the story they want others to believe has muddied the waters and made it extremely difficult to separate truth from legend.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of this is the tale of David and Goliath, a story that we all “know”.  As Malcolm Gladwell explored in a 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_the_unheard_story_of_david_and_goliath&quot;&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt;, the reality behind the story is so much more interesting than the story that we tell each other.  Particularly, the lesson that we consistently take from the famous bible story is focused on the concept of an underdog and being underestimated.  But when you explore the history of battles of that time in addition to an interesting medical theory, David and Goliath tells a very different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early project for students at Compass will utilize this same exploration.  Students will choose a story they’ve known for years, or at least one they think they know.  As part of this project, students will explore the power of storytelling, the development of myths and legends and the way pop culture sometimes restructures the stories we tell.  From the legend of Paul Revere to the multiple historical accounts of St. Nicholas, there are so many stories and legends to explore and learn from.  Final products could be student “legends”, public interviews with Fort Collins’ locals; dissection of Local Fort Collins’ stories (ex: Disney and Harper Goff) and TED Talk-like community storytelling sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Connections:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Studies:&lt;/em&gt; historical context of the given story; legends/myths vs. truth; oral vs. written storytelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading, Writing and Communicating:&lt;/em&gt; creative writing and composition; oral expression and listening; the “Hero’s Journey”; elements of good storytelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arts:&lt;/em&gt;Impact of cultural traditions and events on visual arts within a community&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>A student view of Compass</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/glasses---x----2151-566x---.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of our work close to 2 years ago, one of the most important voices in the design of Compass Community Collaborative has been that of students, not just recent graduates but young adults that are presently in school.  From the Compass Founding Board and Executive Design Team to our pilot program this summer at CSU, getting the perspective of kids that are in school every day has been invaluable in our design. Our model of putting students at the center of the decision-making process began long before we will open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our sharing of our story, we sat down with a local student soon on her way to college. She’s been a part of our team from early on with a goal of not only growing as a leader and designer but of helping build a school that can empower students like her (and maybe her little sister).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;__&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, some background: tell me a little about yourself: where are you in your education, did your parents go to college, what are your dreams for your future in terms of education and career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a senior in high school and hoping to go to CSU next year. My mom graduated from a local high school like I will and my dad dropped out in 6th grade to help his family out on their ranch. I’m not sure what I want to do in the future and what I want to study. As of late, I want to go into early childhood education and social work. I’ve found I really like kids and working with people. Hopefully I’m good at it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you get involved in working with the team to develop CCC and what has motivated you to stay involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I heard about Compass and I got in contact with Jan and stayed since then. With time, I met a lot of the team and realized that there are a lot of passionate people working on this project, something I had never seen before. I wanted to be a part of that because I was passionate too and it was finally a group I could really connect with. I like what Compass stands for, I really think it’s something missing from our community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compass students will be working on “real world” issues. Based on your own experiences in high school, what do you think will be the top three benefits for students to this learning format? You may want to think of what you have learned by working on the development of Compass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First of all, real world issues are more important than a lot of the stuff teachers have to teach because it’s “required”. It’s also a really genuine way to learn in real world context. It’s easier to see why things are important when you know how they apply. Another thing is, I’m assuming there’d be more apparent value for education in students’ eyes. I know if I knew I was doing work that could really help the world I’d look at going to school very differently and put in 100%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think that adults need to know about teens that will make them feel more confident that a school that empowers adolescents the way that CCC will empower them will be a successful school for the students that attend and helpful to the community at large?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think adults need to realize that traditional school is different now. Everything is different now. Things are more innovative so we need to be too, and that starts with our education. Schools like Compass will cater to the more aware and creative aspects in students, guiding them to be the best they can be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you would like to say to families who might be considering enrolling in Compass? Something they should know about your experience in the current school model, or your experience with the prototype, or your confidence in the school development team, or anything else that you want to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just want to say if I was a parent I’d definitely consider enrolling my kids because, when thinking about school, nothing really is worse than having to go to a class that bores you out of your mind. It makes getting up every morning that much harder and the school day that much more uncomfortable. I’m jealous that kids will have such control over what they want to learn and how they’re going to do it. Students will be in the very good hands of a ton of passionate and highly qualified people to lead them in the path of their own successes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Summer Exhibition of Learning</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/versions/IMG_0816---x0-502-1677-1258-1632-1224x---.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every school year there were a couple of school nights that I absolutely dreaded, Back-to-School Night and Parent/ Teacher Conferences. On these nights, I liked getting to know my student’s families and I didn’t really mind being at school late. What I dreaded was being inadvertently asked to defend myself as an educator. Somehow, every year, I would find myself preparing little speeches beforehand as responses to the skeptical questions I would receive all night long. For example: Why aren’t students reading more classics? How are you preparing my kids for SAT vocabulary success? Why don’t we diagram sentences anymore? Now, these are good questions, but in a 5 to 10 minute conference window I would feel cornered and unable to have a real conversation about learning with students and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe it’s time to stop interrogating our educators, even if it is unintentional, and look for different ways to premiere student learning. A better solution is coming together as a community to celebrate student success in an Exhibition of Learning, and that is just what we, at Compass, did on September 1, 2017 during Downtown Fort Collins 1st Friday Art Walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Exhibition of Learning refers to “projects, presentation, or products through which students ‘exhibit’ what they have learned, usually as a way of demonstrating whether and to what degree they have achieved expected learning standards or learning objective”. As Sam and I met the 12 student volunteers we’ve been working with all summer, the Exhibition space at Mesh was already buzzing with activity. The Poudre River Library, expert Drone drivers, Makerspace professionals, and parent volunteers were all preparing the space for our guests. Fortunately, Sam and I were able to have a quiet moment with our students amidst the excitement. This group huddle, in my mind, was the culmination of all of our work together. The relationship building, the inside jokes, the creative and hard work we all did collaboratively was felt in this moment. In particular, I told the students that the idea of having more students like them is a dream of so many people in that room tonight. I wanted them to be proud of their work, but also to feel like a contributor towards something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening progressed smoothly, and in contrast to Back-to-School Night or Parent/ Teacher Conferences, Sam and I decided to have a no “preface” rule. Let the student’s work speak for itself. And it did! We had three full viewings of our student’s Climate Change Films, we had a full Makerspace table, we had parents creating blackout poetry using our student’s poems as examples, we had middle-school boys ushering people in off the street to come view their films. The whole experience was electrifying. Of course, we were still all really tired towards the end, but as Jan often says, “hard work has never been so much fun!” I look forward to many more Exhibitions of Learning at Compass Community Collaborative School.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Compass at the Farmers Market</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;Compass HS was present at this weekend’s Winter Farmer’s Market in the Opera Galleria space in Downtown Fort Collins.  Talking to families, sharing our vision and doing a bit of magic, literally.  If interested in meeting any of us and finding out about more about Compass HS, look for us at future Farmers Markets this winter and spring.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Evaluating Projects (and our own work)</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most refreshing aspects of working on building Compass HS from the ground up is the need for constructive criticism and thoughtful reflection.  All teaching and schools need this but the willingness of the Compass Team to take this on has been impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look at how we will be evaluating our students’ projects at Compass, we thought we’d share an article that gives a nice summary of how multi-modal evaluations play a strong role in project-based learning, especially in terms of utilizing authentic audiences and working to solve real community-based problems.  It’s both a great look at how our assessment of, and development of, students’ skills will take place as well as a reminder of why we, as a staff and learning community, will be using similar processes and strategies to assess our own work and development as a school. (It’s also a nice reminder of the basics of project-based learning, an essential component of Community-Based Learning model)&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Bored Out of their Minds</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;From the Harvard Graduate School of Education:  A look at why students get bored in school and why this is an issue for our public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Todd Rose, author of The End of Average, states, “We need to get away from thinking that the opposite of ‘bored’ is ‘entertained.’ It’s ‘engaged.’”&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Our Compass</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;em&gt;Compass&lt;/em&gt; is our working emotional intelligence charter. It is not a list of rules, rather, it is an agreement created collaboratively among stakeholders describing how they want to feel when working together, specific behaviors required to create and sustain those feelings, and strategies for handling conflict and undesired feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crafting a charter is an effective way to ensure all voices are represented. Our &lt;em&gt;Compass&lt;/em&gt; is foundational to our development. Throughout the rest of our development and as we become operational, at every level of our school – working groups and teams, administrators, faculty and staff, classroom and student groups, families, and community partners – charters will be developed. They will help us align our actions with our intentions in order to fulfill our mission at &lt;em&gt;Compass&lt;/em&gt; High School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research from the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence in schools has shown that by being specific about our collective thoughts and feelings, desired behaviors, and conflict strategies we are better at problem solving, experience fewer conflicts and hurt feelings, and remain focused on our intentions. Furthermore, academics are positively impacted because students have fewer conduct issues allowing for more instruction time and increased participation.The &lt;em&gt;Compass&lt;/em&gt; is a living document. It is referred to often and amended as necessary (to ensure inclusivity and to reflect important changes) so that we continue to move in the desired direction.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Writing our own Story</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the concepts that sets Compass High School apart is our focus on identity: who we are, where we come from and how we see the world.  Our mission in working with students is clear…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;to help students discover learning with purpose; to author the best possible story of their lives and of our collective future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of our core curriculum will be about storytelling as students explore their identity and personal journey.  As part of this exploration, we will work closely with students to help them write their own story, just as we at Compass High School write ours.  So to begin to understand what makes up all stories, please check out this video illustrating Dan Harmon’s universal theory of storytelling, influenced by Joseph Campbell and his concept of the Hero’s Journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you watch, consider your own journey.  How can we take control of our individual lives and, rather than just be bystanders, write our own story?&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>The Benefits of Hosting a High School Intern, by Dave Theobald</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;Carlos M. is a junior in high school, and has worked as an intern at Conservation Science Partners, a non-profit science organization in Fort Collins. He has been assisting in a variety of tasks, but predominantly has helped us to build a database of wildlife crossing structures (e.g., wildlife overpass and underpasses). Carlos has excelled beyond my expectations — generating 2/3 of the records in the database as well as making maps of them, which I featured in my presentation at a professional society conference last week. Beyond the products of his efforts, his quiet but strong presence in our small office (we have ~6 employees) has been powerful. His basic and appropriate questions have forced me to consider a broader context for our work, to think more inclusively, and to be grounded in a clear articulation of why we want to do a particular task. The other day Carlos asked me how to change the colors of icons on a map — I honestly didn’t know how and told him gently: “I really don’t know — figure it out”. An hour later he had tapped a variety of resources, answered his question, and had already moved on to 3 other changes on the map when I caught up with him again. His curiosity and ease in learning new things are infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Solving Real Problems – by Carron Silva</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently traveled to my birthplace of South Africa to help take care of my dad, who has cancer. I may never see him alive again, but my hope is that the next time I return there, it will be with solutions for some of the most mundane problems people face in the so-called “Informal Settlements”. It’s been five years since my last visit, and life in Nelson Mandela’s rainbow nation is challenging on so many levels, especially for the marginalized.  It’s winter down there and people huddle together in corrugated sheeting structures, homes made out of plastic, cardboard and whatever materials scrounged from behind factories and stores. It’s unimaginable that in today’s world children are still being born and raised in such circumstances. However, I have hope that at Compass High School, students will work on simple solutions for the problems of water, shelter and food for the masses. Students will not wait for adults to solve problems, but generate ideas and put into place systems of sustainable practice that enable people to help themselves by forging partnerships with the communities. It could be as simple as creating platforms on which structures can be built so people do not need to live directly in the dirt, and when there is a downpour, they won’t have to elevate sleeping mats or any household goods.  Compass High School will bring hope to people who are struggling to survive, and I am very excited about that!&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Why We Need Compass High School</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;Chloe is a 16 year old who is a new member of our school development team.  She was labeled early in her schooling as a “gifted and talented” student and proved her abilities with straight “A” grades through 9th-grade.  And then she dropped out.  Here is what she has to say about why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“School turned my focus from learning to getting good grades.  Learning started to take on a very negative connotation for me and I started to do the bare minimum to get good grades….While in high school I constantly felt like I was being forced to work towards someone else’s dream.  I had no sense of purpose whatsoever. I was not interested in what I was studying, and frankly, I didn’t feel like it mattered that I felt this way.”&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>What Kids Say They Want</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;We have interviewed and worked students ages 9-25 years old as part of the development of Compass High School.  No matter the age, sex, or success of their current educational endeavors, the resounding message from students is that they find our current educational model largely boring and irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They overwhelmingly describe school as socially important, and most students have at least one teacher that they like and who they believe cares about them.  However, students long for more active, engaging, and meaningful work to inspire them to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;School starts too early in the morning. They are uncomfortable sitting in chairs all day.  They don’t feel that they learn from lectures, Power Points, and worksheets.  Tests and more tests drag them down.  The large homework load gets in the way of spending time on things they love to do and on spending quality time with their friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compass High School is revolutionizing the school experience to meet the needs of 21st Century teens and their families.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>School as an information delivery system: over.</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;Students can find information anywhere and everywhere they look.  The truth is, we are all overloaded with information.  What we need is a way to discern whether the information we are consuming is accurate, unbiased, and useful in our quest to making ourselves, our community, and our world a better place for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compass High School is a school for the 21st Century: we ask questions instead of giving answers, we provide resources instead of assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

             <title>Motivation</title>
             <description>&lt;p&gt;In Daniel Pink’s seminal book, Drive, published in 2009, he reveals three critical elements of motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.  It’s no coincidence that “helping students discover learning with purpose….” is part of our mission statement for Compass High School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just this month, there have been interviews all over the news with Angela Duckworthy, author of her newly published book, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.  In this book, book she outlines what she learned in her study of “grit”, the determination to get hard things done and to become great at something you care about. The secret; passion for what you are doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These authors and so many more have showed us conclusively what motivates humans. At Compass High School, our model of community-based, interdisciplinary, student-driven education is all about tapping into those primary needs for autonomy, mastery, purpose…. and we’ll add one more: community (belonging).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-have-to-learn-this-are-words-we-never-hear-at-compass-high-school&quot;&gt;“Why do we have to learn this?”” are words we never hear at Compass High School&lt;/h2&gt;
