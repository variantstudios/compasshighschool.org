### **Who are we?**

Are you a trailblazer, observer, visionary, and innovator ready to discover learning with purpose alongside a team of students and professional educators? We are. And we are looking for a paraprofessional to join our team. We believe in place-based education that shifts learning out of the traditional classroom setting and puts kids back into the community ready to share their unique genius. We are Compass Community Collaborative School.

We will open in August 2018, serving a diverse population of students in grades 6-10 from across Northern Colorado. Employing a hands-on learning curriculum, we will inspire thoughtful and creative problem-solvers who aspire to live with integrity and compassion and have the skills to be positive change-makers in the world. Compass Community Collaborative is dedicated to personalized, competency-based learning to help all students discover learning with purpose; to author the best story of their lives and our collective future.

### **What are we looking for? &nbsp;**

Compass is looking for a full-time (40 hours/week) person who loves to work with adolescents, especially those who need extra support during the school day.

You will work under the direction of our Special Education teacher, but you will collaborate with all staff in the building as you work with students in our school building and out in the community (we will travel by MAX bus and foot). You will support students working on a computer-based curriculum (Summit Learning Platform) as well as on venture projects that involve real-world application of academic skills (reading, writing, researching, applying mathematics to problem solving) and social emotional skills (collaborating with peers and community partners, planning and completing work, conflict management).
