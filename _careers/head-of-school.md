My name is Tim Martinez and I wish to serve the Compass Community Collaborative School as Head of School. During my career I have had the pleasure of serving students in a leadership capacity at the school level and as part of district senior staff. I am an experienced school Principal and Teacher, educating students ages 3 -18 for over twenty-six years. I enjoy a strong instructional background while balancing instructional expertise with valuable operational skill. In addition, I have first-hand experience with new school development as Director of Strategy. As Superintendent of Colorado&rsquo;s first blended learning school I learned I thrive on the challenge of making dreams of education, come true.</span></span></span></p></div>

So why CCC? I believe strongly in the CCC vision. I believe in the power of communication and collaboration. I believe my experience provides you with a proven school leader who maintains high personal and professional standards and one who know how to build a successful school. I believe students center any school. I envy the power of skillful teachers. While most individuals have instructional skill or operational skill, seldom do candidates have both; I have both instructional skill and operational know how. I can navigate new school design challenges and I believe I am the best candidate to lead Compass Community Collaborative School. I look forward to sharing more about my desire to serve the CCC community.
