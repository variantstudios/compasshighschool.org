title: How will Compass ensure student safety with all of the community collaborations?
answer: >-
  Compass, like all schools, takes the safety of students very seriously. All
  community mentors who work with students one on one will be required to get
  fingerprinted and have a background check. There will also be training for our
  students and community mentors about appropriate and professional expectations,
  including the need for all students to be in common spaces (where other people
  will be around) with their mentors.

  Older students may be independently traveling on public transportation to their
  satellite campuses and internships. Parents will sign a blanket permission slip
  at the beginning of each semester when the student designs their plan of
  learning with their Compass advisor to allow this travel and work outside of
  our school building. Parents will have contact information for the alternate
  learning locations and students will be required to wear a chipped badge at all
  times when they are off campus. The chipped badge will allow administrators at
  the school to locate the student if there is any question as to their
  whereabouts (this is like the software that Apple uses in their “find my iphone
  app”).
