title: Why is Compass using a different model for assessing and transcripting student work?
answer: 'In our rapidly changing world, we believe that equipping students with the skills to be lifelong learners and positive change-makers is our number one job. Students will learn Colorado core content standards with the help of certified, highly-qualified teachers. However, they will learn these standards at different times, in a multitude of ways, throughout their years at Compass High School.In order to keep students from focusing on grades instead of learning, they will build a professional portfolio of their learning products and earn degrees inside eight, skill-focused digital badges while they are working at Compass High School. Ultimately, academic work will be assigned grades based on competency levels attained so that students will have transcripts for other schools, but this is not the form of feedback we will use as students demonstrate their learning.'
