title: Will the teachers be certified teachers and will they be highly qualified in a wide variety of academic subject areas?
answer: >-
  Our curriculum will be highly individualized so as to offer challenge and
  growth for every student. We will build on strengths and interests, but also
  continually push students to try new things.

  Students will be tested three times a year (MAPS testing) to measure their
  growth, and all students will be prepared for annual PARCC, CMAS, and for
  college entrance exams such as SAT tests.

  Compass students will take a college class as part of their graduation
  requirements. This may be a credit-bearing, online course from any university
  in the country, or a classroom course at FRCC or CSU. We believe that students
  need to experience a college course before they leave high school in order to
  be best prepared and feel confident in their skills to attend college.

  Students will graduate with a web-based portfolio of work to demonstrate both
  their academic skills and their 21st Century skills mastery. They will also
  have a professional resume and a letter of reference from a professional with
  whom they completed an extensive job internship. All of these assets will help
  them get into a college or university of their choice, but more importantly,
  they will be invaluable in demonstrating a student has the grit and persistence
  to successfully finish college with a degree.

  Graduation requirements from Compass will ensure that each student has met at
  least one of the following criteria:

  – Has been accepted into a college of their choice with a reasonable plan for
  payment

  – Has been accepted into a gap year program with a reasonable plan for payment

  – Has been hired for a self-sustaining job in which they will continue to grow
  and learn

  – Has been accepted into an internship/apprenticeship, or certificate program
  of their choice
