title: What is a charter school and how is it different than a private or other public school?
answer: 'Charter schools are public schools. There is no tuition required. Charter schools are authorized and overseen by the State or a local District school board, but they have their own Board of Directors. Like other charter schools in Fort Collins, we will have a lottery for admission.'
