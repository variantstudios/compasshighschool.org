title: Will there be school buses available to transport students to and from Compass?
answer: 'For the most part, families will be responsible for getting their children to and from school each day. We will locate our school near public transportation and bikeable routes so that students can get to school on their own. We will help families set up carpools from different parts of Fort Collins. Eventually, we plan to have a fleet of vans that may be available to pick students up if we have several students coming from one neighborhood.'
