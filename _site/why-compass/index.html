<p>and, “When will I ever use this?”, are questions students are asking in classes every day. Compass High School will provide them with the skills and opportunities to answer this question themselves. Through project-based learning and collaborative initiatives with local businesses and university partners, our mission is to help students discover learning with purpose. We are charting a new course at Compass High School– leaving behind the well-worn paths of schools designed to study individual academic disciplines at levels determined by age. We are creating a school that is student-centered and community-based. More than delivering curriculum, we are nurturing the development of intellectual intelligence, emotional intelligence, creativity, and curiosity in our students and their families.</p>

<p>Fort Collins has many school choices, and now with the opening of Compass High School in 2018, there will be an innovative addition to our Choice City’s menu. Students in 6th grade and above are invited to join our high school to excel in areas of interest and strength, get support in areas they need help, and to have the opportunity to explore and contribute to our community.  Students can earn an associate’s degree or trade certificate before graduation, and will have training in project development and strategic planning that will serve them throughout their adolescence and adulthood, no matter where their compass guides them.</p>

<h2 id="compass-high-school-mission">COMPASS HIGH SCHOOL MISSION</h2>
<p>Our mission is to help students discover learning with purpose, to be authors of the best possible story of their lives and of our collective future. We recognize the unique attributes and needs of adolescents and actively support their development of identity, competency, and agency. We ask questions instead of giving answers. We provide resources instead of assignments. We embrace our community’s entrepreneurial nature and energy. Our teachers and our local, national, and international partners collaborate with our students and their families to chart a path of opportunity. Our students graduate as co-creators of a learning life.</p>

<h2 id="why-compass">WHY COMPASS?</h2>
<p>The question that students are asking in classes all over the country is: “Why do I need to learn this?” Compass High School will provide them with the skills and opportunities to answer this question themselves. Our 21st Century school is being designed by a diverse team of educators, students, artists, and community leaders in an entrepreneurial business incubator where we are embedding secondary education into real world problem solving and meaningful work. With the help and expertise of a “Mapping Team” (teachers, peers, and community mentors) our students, ages 11-19, will earn badges in eight skill areas as they work on community-based projects that inspire deep learning of academic, social emotional, and 21st Century skills.
At Compass, we see collaborative community, teacher, and student design, research, and problem solving as a game changer for how adolescents view their place in our community, and how the community views the capacities of our youth. Opposed to the current model where kids spend everyday in a building separate from the “real world”, we will have adolescents working in multi-age, interdisciplinary teams, and side-by-side with community members to actively participate in the creation of our future. Individualized and competency-based, students will be challenged every day to grow and to demonstrate their learning in a multitude of real-world applications.</p>

<h2 id="the-compass-high-school-difference">THE COMPASS HIGH SCHOOL DIFFERENCE</h2>
<p>Project-based learning is at the heart of the Compass High School difference. The project-based learning approach puts students in the driver’s seat of creating work that matters to them and their community, while challenging them to apply their knowledge and creativity across many subjects.</p>

<p>Each school-year students will complete at least eight projects (two per quarter). They may be a combination of teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects, and community-inspired projects. All projects will be interdisciplinary and will meet the state academic standards for core disciplines, including art, health, and physical education. Students will be challenged to continuously reflect on their mastery of the eight skill areas and Colorado academic standards. Presentations of Learning will be evaluated by teachers, student peers, parents, and community mentors on a quarterly basis, but students will be given regular feedback over the course of each project.</p>

<p>Newer students will conduct projects in and around the school and will work on teacher-led projects to develop the skills to manage their learning. Experienced Compass High School students who have demonstrated required academic and skill competencies will have the opportunity to intern/ partner with community mentors on passion projects and in career fields in which they are interested.</p>

<p>To graduate, students must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate competency in all of the state academic standards.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate competency in all eight of the 21st Century Skills (see below).</li>
  <li>Have completed at least one concurrent enrollment or college/university class.</li>
  <li>Have completed at least one professional internship and have a letter of recommendation from a supervisor for college or work applications.</li>
  <li>Be accepted into a 2 or 4-year college and have a realistic plan to pay tuition, OR have a self-sustaining and meaningful job, apprenticeship, or certificate program in which they will continue to learn and have opportunity for advancement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-daily-schedule-is-different-too">Our daily schedule is different, too!</h2>
<p>Mornings can be very stressful. When teens are hard to awaken, and family members need to be in different places at different times, mornings can turn into a race against the clock. To allow our families to take some of the stress out of the morning routine, and to give teens a chance to get the sleep that brain research demonstrates they need, we are providing flexibility in the daily start and end times for Compass High School. Student’s start and end time will be established with each family at the beginning of each semester, however, all students and staff will be directly involved in Compass High School work for a minimum of 7.5 hours per day.</p>

<p>08:00 a.m.	Each family sets an arrival time in the 8-9:30 a.m. window that works best for them.
Project work, individual meetings with mentors, and/or small group lessons and individual tutoring may be scheduled for this time period.
09:30 a.m.	Advisory

<h2 id="foundations-of-compass-high-school">FOUNDATIONS OF COMPASS HIGH SCHOOL</h2>
<p>We are charting a new course at Compass High School. Leaving behind the well worn paths of schools designed to study individual academic disciplines at levels determined by age group, we are creating a school that is student-centered and community-based. We are not just in the business of information and curriculum delivery, we are nurturing the development of intellectual intelligence (IQ), emotional intelligence (EQ), creativity (CrQ) and curiosity (CuQ) in our students and their families. We are starting a school to prepare students and families to discover learning with purpose; to author the best possible story of their lives and of our collective future.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Self-directed, project-based learning in service to a greater cause than just our own learning: Education with purpose and real-world relevance.</em>
Students will learn in multi-age, interdisciplinary teams to develop foundational life and learning skills by working on projects that are meaningful to the themselves and to our community. They will study standards-based math, science, social studies, and language arts, Spanish, art, and health with the help of certified teachers and online resources in small group seminars related to their projects. Demonstrating proficiency in academics, social emotional learning, and life skills will be supported by regular feedback from staff, peers, and community mentors. Students will create a map for each quarter of the school year, including summer session (off campus), to meet their growth requirements and to excel in areas of interest. At least twice each year, students will meet with their advisor to reassess their progress toward graduation, and will make any course corrections necessary to stay on track to be post-secondary ready by age eighteen.</li>
  <li><em>Small group seminars and online resources for academic learning:</em>
All new students to Compass High will complete an extensive interests interview and skills evaluation to help staff to effectively meet the needs of each individual as they plan projects and design learning seminars. Seminars in foundational academic subjects will be held on an ongoing basis so students can have access, support, and practice to reach graduation requirements and meet their goals on projects, standardized tests, college courses, as well as internship and job applications. Concurrent enrollment opportunities will allow students to fulfill their graduation requirement of taking at least one college class; earning an associate’s degree before graduation will also be an option for any student who wants to pursue an early start on college credits. Academic, strategic planning, social emotional skills, and 21st Century skill building in context of the students’ applied learnings will keep students in the driver’s seat. It will allow them to learn quickly and effectively, with enough productive struggle that they build confidence and a growth mindset.</li>
  <li><em>Intentional culture and climate:</em>
Connection will be at the heart of our school culture; connection between people, between humans and the natural environment, between the past, present, and future. Both adults and adolescents will value the unique assets, perspectives, and experiences of individuals, as well as the strength we have together as a learning community.To build and nurture this connected culture, at Compass High School:
    <ul>
      <li>Our certified teachers will be co-learners, collaborators and academic content coaches. Teachers will work collaboratively with each other and with community partners on projects in addition to serving as coaches and mentors to each other. At Compass High, teachers are interdependent and independent just like our students.</li>
      <li>Students will participate in peer mentoring programs in which the more experienced students mentor the newer students to help them learn how to be successful and happy in our community.</li>
      <li>Daily morning meetings in Advisories will assure all students start the day connected to the school community and that they are physically and mentally ready to learn.</li>
      <li>Restorative practices will give students a chance to learn from their mistakes; we will focus on restorative justice so that all of us have the skills and opportunities to live up to our community’s high expectations by taking responsibility for our behavior and making amends when we make mistakes.</li>
      <li>Regular celebrations and rituals that reflect our highest expectations and our deepest values of inclusiveness, empathy, gratitude, hard work, and responsibility will be the waypoints by which we will navigate development and sustenance of our school culture.
4.<em>Health, wellness, diversity, and equity of opportunity:</em>
The design of our daily schedule — our project-based learning, our physical environment, our weighted lottery admissions policy (more spaces for students who will be the first in their families to attend college), the food we eat, and our daily team/school meetings –will clearly demonstrate to students and their families that Compass High is committed to helping them write the best possible story of their lives and our collective future. Beyond academics, our students will be explicitly taught, and given ample opportunity to practice, having healthy relationships with caring adults and with peers. Equally as important, they will learn and be able to practice having a healthy relationship with themselves — skills including mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, humor, growth mindset, self-advocacy, reframing and learning from challenge, setting goals, and other powerful tools that will help to combat the rising tide of anxiety, drug abuse, obesity, conflict, and escapism we see in students and the world.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Environmental sustainability and regeneration:</em>
Our learning ecosystem will be a champion of protecting and healing the Earth’s natural ecosystems. Our school building will be designed as a showcase of environmental sustainability for the 21st Century by being smaller than traditional high schools and by including state of the art solar and geothermal energy systems within the well-insulated and thoughtfully designed building. Our campus will include “satellites” in which our staff and students can work with and for local partners in their buildings or in alternative spaces that are not fully utilized during typical school hours. Carbon neutrality will extend to our transportation model for staff and students; we will keep our parking lot small and encourage public transportation and bikes as the preferred mode of travel between home, school, and community partners. We will not have school busses, but instead will eventually own a fleet of passenger vans that our students will convert from gas to electric in the context of learning projects. By growing food on-site, engaging in projects in our surrounding wilderness areas, and partnering with local environmental nonprofits, we will further reduce our environmental footprint and teach students to be stewards of our precious natural resources.</li>
  <li><em>Post-secondary preparation and career exploration:</em>
Our school IS the community. It is not a place where kids have to wait to “start their lives”. When they enter our school, they will be treated as people with valuable opinions, self-knowledge, and gifts to share with the world. They will be supported in creating the path of personal fulfillment and community service that is their life.Technology will be used to support student learning, exploration, creativity, problem solving, connecting, and sharing. From our project-based learning management software and digital badging, to 3-D printers in a maker space, programmable controls to manage energy use in the building, scientific tools to maximize ecological health in the greenhouses, to the design of their digital portfolios, students will be masters of their digital universe and will have the skills to succeed in college and beyond.All students will prepare for community college and/or university entrance exams and will take at least one concurrent enrollment and/or college course before graduation. Additionally, students will have completed a minimum of one semester-long professional internship by the time they graduate. This will assure that they have a professional resume, a letter of reference for future employment, and the confidence to interview for positions on their career journey.Helping graduates navigate the first year of post-secondary experience is explicitly designed into school staffing resources. Whether students graduate and travel the world, enroll in college, start a business, or join an existing business, our staff will be available to offer continued coaching and encouragement as they make their way on their journey in life.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="21st-century-skills-competencies">21st CENTURY SKILLS COMPETENCIES</h2>
<p>With the guidance of evidence-based research, we have created eight core competencies that will drive instruction, reflection, and assessment of mastery for both staff and students. In addition to academic common core standards and next generation science standards, master of these eight skills will guide teacher evaluation and measure student achievement:</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="community-involvement">COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT</h2>
<p>Our community partnerships are what sets Compass High School apart from any other high school in our district. Students will become part of a larger community as they experience opportunities to work as volunteers and interns with City government, Colorado State University professors and students, Woodward, Inc., the Downtown Artery, the Fort Collins Bike Co-Op, the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery, UC Health, and many other businesses and nonprofits. All students will graduate having had at least one extensive internship in the community. These first-hand experiences will help create meaning and relevancy for students as they co-create a future for themselves and our community.</p>

<p>Additional ways that we are breaking down barriers between school and community include our monthly Community Conclaves and our monthly “Lunch and Learn” programs. Compass will host “lunch and learn” presentations on various topics of interest to students and their families and these events will be open to the public. The Community Conclaves will be special evening events in which businesses, students, and citizens with ideas for Compass projects, or particular problems they are concerned about solving, can pitch their ideas to the Compass community to develop opportunities for collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="family-involvement">FAMILY INVOLVEMENT</h2>
<p>Compass High School will be an active partner with parents to help raise the next generation of change makers.</p>

<p>Partnering with families is part of what will make our climate and culture exceptional. In addition to being part of our quarterly Presentations of Learning celebrations, we will also welcome our families to evening classes to learn English, computer skills, and tricks of the trade in the difficult job of parenting. Additionally, parents will be an important connection to the working world by offering internships, project ideas, business connections, and expertise for our students. Other classes and opportunities for parents and families will be created on a year-by-year basis in response to family needs and interests.</p>

<p><em>One of our highest priorities at Compass is to take care of our families; we welcome ideas and opportunities to make your student’s success a family affair.</em></p>

<h2 id="enrollment-process">ENROLLMENT PROCESS</h2>
