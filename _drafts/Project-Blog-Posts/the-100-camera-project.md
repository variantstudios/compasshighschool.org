*As we get closer to our opening, we will be sharing **Project Proposals**, examples of projects that we will be working on with students at Compass.&nbsp; Keeping in mind that student voice is an important element in any project, these proposals will be a framework of projects with the potential to evolve as student interest and voice are integrated into our curriculum. However, these are meant as examples to illustrate a primary component of students' learning at Compass.*
