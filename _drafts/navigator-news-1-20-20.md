# How Does One Design and Open an Innovative School?

![](/assets/images/technology-connects-schools-across-the-country.jpg){: width="934" height="590"}

***Technology is connecting schools across the country. Last week Compass School Leader, Jan Harrison, spoke to students in Boston\!&nbsp;***

Jan was honored to be invited to speak to a history class at the [Cambridge School of Westin](https://www.csw.org) in the Boston area about designing innovative schools. The students are juniors at this private school that focuses on creative arts and music and they had read and discussed several books about the history of education in the United States. As their capstone project for the class, they are working on designing their “dream school” and they had lots of questions about how one actually goes about designing and launching an innovative school. It was a fun hour for all of us\!

Their self-chosen goal is to complete 3,000 math problems this year, and they have already completed 2,287 as of January 17\! We wish them and our additional individual competitors—Rhoen, Karleigh, Amoreah, and Chase—the best of luck at MathCounts Regionals on February 22\! Go, Compass\!
