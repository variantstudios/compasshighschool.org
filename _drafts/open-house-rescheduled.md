A quick reminder to our families and friends:

Our building Open House originally scheduled for tonight has been rescheduled due to weather.&nbsp; The new date/time is Saturday, May 12th from 5-7 pm.&nbsp; Obviously, same location: 2105 S. College Ave.&nbsp; Check your calendars.&nbsp; Invite a friend.&nbsp; Come check out our space and maybe give your thoughts on a few design components.

Look forward to seeing you all soon. &nbsp;
