Welcome Back to School\!
{: .cta}

**The Compass staff wishes everyone a warm welcome back to school\! It's going to be another great year\!\!&nbsp;**

This year Compass will spend the first week of school building culture and teaching students important skills for success in our school model. This will include how to design and execute independent Inquiries, how to log learning in [Foundry](foundry education platform){: target="_blank"}, and lots more\!&nbsp;

The schedule for returning students is slightly different than the schedule for new students, and 6th-graders have a slightly different schedule than older new students, but ALL students will have their Advisory as their home base. Parents, please check your email to view your students Culture Week schedule.

**Your students will have their final schedule for the first semester on Friday**, and regular learning experiences (and regular start and end times) will start next Monday, August 26th. Get ready to LOVE SCHOOL\!

Venture Highlight
{: .cta}

Dawn DuPriest will be starting her year off with a group of middle and upper school students in a Venture focused on&nbsp;**FIRST LEGO League Robotics and Tech Challenges**. The theme of the competition this year is “City-Shaper”. In her usual high fashion, Dawn has already found a community partner for the Venture\!&nbsp;**The students will be working on a real-world problem of urban design with the City of Fort Collins Planning Department.**&nbsp;They were really excited to participate. We live in such a great city\!&nbsp;

While the venture will officially end in late October, the student teams will continue to meet during an intensive and after school until the competitions in November. Students will be building and programming robots that can perform all kinds of tasks related to building a strong, beautiful, sustainable city- and helping the city of Fort Collins with its plans for a better future. It’s a fantastic, real-world activity that builds student STEM knowledge, leadership, and problem solving skills.&nbsp;

Compass will support three FLL teams and Dawn is looking for three students who would like to be team captains. These team captains will meet with the Fort Collins City Planning Department to talk about projects that students can help with to kick off the Venture. The first meeting with the city is Wednesday, Aug. 21, so team captains will miss their afternoon Inquiry Project to take the MAX to meet with city planners downtown.

If you are interested in being an FLL Team Captain and beginning this work of helping plan a better City of Fort Collins, please fill out&nbsp;[THIS SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejrm4e6GPeKtqV6yuJMq8gFOlwHttx99IetyYU2zF3RchblQ/viewform){: target="_blank"}\!

In addition, if you are an adult interested in volunteering at Compass to help our FLL teams with competitive robotics, please send an email to&nbsp;[dawn@compassfortcollins.org&nbsp;](mailto:dawn@compassfortcollins.org){: target="_blank"}and let her know\!

Compass students do more than just master traditional academic content. With the guidance of evidence-based research, we have created&nbsp;**seven core competencies**&nbsp;that drive instruction, reflection, and assessment of mastery for both staff and students.&nbsp;

Adaptability, Flexibility, Problem Solving, Inquiry and Analysis are central to&nbsp;**CRITICAL THINKING**—one of the seven Compass Core Competencies. The Compass "THINK" tee is a nod to Albert Einstein, his imagination, and his very original way of THINKing.&nbsp;

This t-shirt is the first in a series of seven that will roll out over the coming years—one each semester.**&nbsp;This t-shirt is only available for order during this 2-week FLASH sale period.**&nbsp;We cannot guarantee that it will be available for sale in the future**—order yours now for the kids, for yourself and for all your THINKing friends\! Order by August 28.**

This t-shirt as being offered close to cost. If over 100 sell, the Parent Action Council (PAC) will profit roughly $200. These funds will be used to support PAC activities (teacher appreciation, student events, etc.) for the 2019-20 school year.
