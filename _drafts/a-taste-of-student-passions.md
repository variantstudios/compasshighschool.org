On January 8th, CCCS held the 2nd "Taste of Compass", an opportunity for interested families and students to get an idea of what education looks like in our model.&nbsp; While parents and guardians participated in a Q&A with Compass team members, a group of 30 prospective students worked with staff members to brainstorm their personal interests and begin to explore how their passions could lead to interdisciplinary projects.&nbsp; Here's some of what students came up with:

* Scooters
* Trampolines
* Journaling (including *Wreck this Journal*)
* Scrapbooking
* Friends
* Animals (dogs, fish, cats, other pets)
* The environment
* Creativity (art, drawing, photography, creation and design)
* Cooking
* Theater
* Movies
* History
* Programming Robots
* Outdoor recreation
* Hiking
* Legos
* Soccer
* Reading (...late into the night)
* Being active
* Learning
* Languages
* Music
* Architecture
* Equality / equal rights
* WWII
* Video games (Minecraft, etc.)
* Games and Sports (basketball, lacrosse, skiing, dancing, snowboarding, football, roller skating, ice skating, running, gymnastics and swimming)
* Talking and communication
* Greek mythology
* Volunteering&nbsp;
* Star Wars
* Anime
* Sewing
* Comics
* Family
* Makeup and styling
* Sleep

The diversity in ideas was amazing.&nbsp; Often, teachers make the assumption that students' interests are limited to video games, their friends and themselves (and, yes, these come up) but the students interested in CCCS are looking for a lot more.&nbsp; From service opportunities, a better understanding of history and the use of the design process to improve their world, we got a taste of what students will bring to Compass.&nbsp; Students then put their ideas together to create project ideas that will allow them to explore their interests in an academic context and better understand themselves and the world around in the process.
