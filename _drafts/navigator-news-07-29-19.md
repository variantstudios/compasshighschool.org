**Wendy Rose is our new “Futures” Counselor**—an innovative take on a “college and career” counselor. Wendy comes to us from 14 years in career counseling at CSU and as a partner in one of our local, successful startup companies, Topo Designs. At CSU, Wendy was surprised by how many college students she worked with didn’t seem to know their strengths, interests, or skills. Without this autonomy and purpose, being successful at the university was difficult for these young adults. By joining the Compass team, Wendy will be able to help high school students graduate with the skills and self-knowledge to thrive in their post-secondary endeavors. Wendy has great connections in Fort Collins and at CSU and will offer rich opportunities through our seminars for all of our students\!&nbsp;

**Shamayim Watson is traveling across the world to work with Compass staff and students to explore all things social studies.**&nbsp;She will partner with Bonnie Cowen to create a creative and engaging exploration of history, geography, economics, civics, and more. Shamayim has a master’s degree in education from Oxford University and has taught 4th-12th grade students in England, Ghana, and India. She brings a wealth of academic knowledge in her subject area and in International Baccalaureate, as well as infectious enthusiasm, curiosity, and fun\!

&nbsp;

**Claire Lute is a licensed music (and English) teacher**&nbsp;and has spent the last several years offering private music lessons and working in the Loveland public schools. It is probably not too much to say that Claire is a musical prodigy—she is proficient on ALL band and orchestral instruments as well as voice, piano, and guitar. She will be teaching various music classes during Monday seminars as well as several Intensive series. She may also offer private music lessons if there is interest from our students and families. &nbsp;

**Art seminars on Monday afternoons will be taught by Erica Quihuiz**, a recent graduate of the print-making program at CSU. When she is not helping inspire artistic genius at Compass, Erica works at the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery. We are thrilled to continue to build our art program at Compass and look forward to working with other local artists to enhance our offerings and diversify our skill levels.&nbsp;

**WELCOME TO ALL OF OUR FABULOUS, NEW STAFF\!**

Join MathCounts\!
{: .cta}

**Do you want to have fun and get better at math at the same time? Join our new&nbsp;*MathCounts&nbsp;*program at Compass\!**&nbsp;**MATHCOUNTS&reg; is a national Middle School program that encourages students to increase their math skills through learning, teamwork, and competition.**&nbsp;

We will meet during PLT (the beginning or end of the school day) to conquer new problems and we’ll do fun team building activities (evening laser tag, hikes, lock-ins, etc.) at least once a month. We’ll also qualify Compass for the National Math Club gold level\! At Compass, you can choose your path. MathCounts can be your “math class” for the year if you are in pre-algebra or you can participate in MathCounts in addition to taking math intensives.

MathCounts is for grades 6-8 only. Having math as your best subject is not required to join\! You only need a desire to learn and willingness to help our team meet our goals.&nbsp;[Download a flier](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T2AdimjA6zd_n-n2u8oEqPk6jUoa5BSJ){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for more information or email&nbsp;[karen@compassfortcollins.org](mailto:karen@compassfortcollins.org){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

Please come to meet Karen and other students who are interested in joining this program\! Join a fun Spring Creek trail hike on Monday, August 12, 2019. Meet at Compass at 6:20p for a 6:30p departure. Please wear comfortable shoes and bring water for hiking along the Spring Creek Trail and money for Dairy Queen (if you want to get a treat at the finish line). Bring rain gear if rainy\! It’s a “go” in any weather. Also, please do plan to walk—no bikes/scooters/skateboards—so people can talk to each other. Questions? Please email&nbsp;[karen@compassfortcollins.org](mailto:karen@compassfortcollins.org){: target="_blank"}. She will bring her 9th-grader to be the “end of the line”.
