Support an Independent Venture
{: .cta}

**My name is Laisa, and I am a junior at Compass Community Collaborative School. I'm looking for Compass families to donate materials for new mothers in our community.&nbsp;**

As part of my Independent Venture I am creating self-care packages for ten new mothers in the northern Fort Collins community. This package would include necessities for their new babies, self-care goodies, reminders to practice self-care, and reasons why they should be sure to take good care of themselves as new mothers.

Possible donations may include; Gently used or new blankets, diapers, gently used or new baby clothes, baby bibs, face masks, body scrubs, bath salts, bath bombs, nail polish, gift cards.

**Please bring your donations to Exhibition\!&nbsp;**Thank you for your support.

Robotics News

**Congratulations to the Compass FIRST Lego League teams for a fantastic season.&nbsp;**During first quarter, these students learned together in a Robotics venture, and then they continued as an intensive class during second quarter to prepare for competing. In FIRST Lego League, the students built and programmed robots to complete missions for points, and they created an innovation project to solve a community problem—all related to the theme of city planning.&nbsp;

Team&nbsp;*\#Moralsupport*&nbsp;received a Judge’s Award (an honorable mention) at the Poudre tournament on November 16.Team&nbsp;*Make This\!&nbsp;*received the first-place Champion award at the Liberty tournament on November 9, and they competed at the Colorado Championship on December 7. The students achieved a personal best score that day and represented Compass well.

All of the students learned about teamwork, community engagement, gracious professionalism, and STEM in a real context—tons of fun and learning went on. We are very proud to bring home our first competitive robotics trophies, with many more to come in the future\! Congratulations to all teams\!
