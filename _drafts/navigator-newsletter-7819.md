Hello and Farewell
{: .cta}

**With August just around the corner, we want to introduce our families to our new staff members and share our gratitude for some of last year’s staff that will be moving on to new adventures in their own careers.&nbsp;**

First we want to thank&nbsp;**Will Allen**,&nbsp;**Danny Hanlon**,&nbsp;**Hadar Zeigerson** (below), and&nbsp;**Kari Nevins**&nbsp;for all the hard work, good humor, and expertise they shared with Compass staff and students throughout the last school year. They each added so much to our community, and they will all be missed as regular members of our staff\! Each of them is off on new profess

onal and personal adventures and we wish them the best. We trust that they will each come back to pay us visits (and hopefully find new roles with us) and we look forward to learning about their new pursuits.

Our new staff will bring their own flavor of expertise and experience and they promise to enrich our school further.**&nbsp;In this and our next few newsletters we will be introducing you to some of these wonderful additions to our community.**

**New math teachers, Karen Karppinen and Elana Sobol, will join Dawn Dupriest in creating an engaging, effective, and creative math department.**Elana will focus on middle school math instruction while Dawn and Karen will focus on more advanced coursework. Elana has been teaching middle school math in St.Vrain School District, and Karen has experience teaching in public schools, home school programs, and most recently, at Ridgeview Classical School and University of Northern Colorado. All three bright, creative, hard-working, and experienced math teachers will collaborate to make Compass’ math curriculum robust and responsive to both the students and the demands of college and career. Welcome Elana and Karen\!
