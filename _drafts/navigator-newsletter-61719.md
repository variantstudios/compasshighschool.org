Teacher Workshop Week
{: .cta}

![](/assets/images/unnamed-22.jpg){: width="1000" height="750"}

**Compass staff spent the week of June 3-7 working together to reflect on all that we had learned during Compass’ first year and refining and creating new learning experiences and protocols to make next year even better.&nbsp;**Most of our new staff members were also able to join us, which made the opportunity double as an “onboarding” and get-to-know-you week for us as well as for them. Even Shamayim Watson, our new Social Studies teacher, was able to FaceTime with us for a while from England. We love our new staff members and know that you will too\!

**Not surprisingly, more than two full days of our work centered around getting familiar with our new learning management system,&nbsp;[Foundry](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=ffe63ccead&amp;e=46f52667a0){: target="_blank"}.**&nbsp;It is a robust enterprise software that is being customized specifically for Compass, and it will make so much of the powerful learning going on at Compass more rigorous, transparent, and trackable.We also pitched and gave feedback on&nbsp;**Venture Project proposals**, we defined&nbsp;**learning targets for Intensive classes**, and we worked on differentiating programs for middle and high school level students.

As per Compass usual, we circled up regularly, and all of our circles were powerful reminders of what makes our school so special—we are a community of gratitude and hope, and nothing is more powerful than those two qualities working together\!

Magic Solutions in Education?

[A recent post to&nbsp;](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=1816359fbd&amp;e=46f52667a0){: target="_blank"}[the education-focused blog MindShift](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=4ac39209c9&amp;e=46f52667a0){: target="_blank"}, by Linda Flanagan, reported findings from a recent study of&nbsp;**what makes a school successful in getting students to engage deeply in learning**.The researchers, Jal&nbsp;[Mehta](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=8bb9d96bca&amp;e=46f52667a0){: target="_blank"}, an associate professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Sarah&nbsp;[Fine](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=cc63211931&amp;e=46f52667a0){: target="_blank"}, Program Director of Teaching Apprenticeship at High Tech High Graduate School of Education, found that&nbsp;*there are no magic solutions in education*. But after&nbsp;**visiting 30 schools**, conducting&nbsp;**300 interviews**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**sitting in on classes for 750 hours**,&nbsp;**they have much to say about HOW the best schools and teachers operate**.What they noticed, in particular, was how these teachers and the administrations that support them&nbsp;**invite students to engage deeply in their educations**. For Mehta and Fine, “[deeper learning](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=e3632c0109&amp;e=46f52667a0){: target="_blank"}” consists of three interrelated conditions:

1. **Mastery:**&nbsp;When students fathom a subject.
2. **Identity:**&nbsp;When they connect the knowledge of the subject to their own sense of self.
3. **Creativity:&nbsp;**When students can apply that understanding to another endeavor in what Mehta calls&nbsp;*“the next layer of learning.”*

**The findings in this research point to the validity and importance of the goals and values that Compass Community Collaborative School holds&nbsp;**and the importance of the practices and structures we are refining with our committed and experienced staff going into our second year.
