### Staff: Jason Malone

#### **Assistant School Lead**

###### &nbsp;

###### Six Word Memoir:&nbsp;

*"Never seems to be enough time."*

###### What's your educational specialty/background?

*I have a Bachelor's Degree in Biology, a Masters Degree in Education and an Administrative License. I started my career as a biology teacher but soon grew to love so much more. After a decade, I stepped outside of science and taught high school epistemology (study of knowledge) for many years. Other roles I've held along the way include: High School Tennis Coach for 12 years, International Baccalaureate Educational Consultant, Workshop Leader and Program Evaluator since 2006; Director of the IB Middle Years Program at Poudre High School for almost a decade; Associate Director of the Colorado State University Writing Project for five years.&nbsp; I share all of this to emphasize that I love learning and I love a new challenge.&nbsp; Compass is the culmination of all of this work.*

###### Why Compass?

*It's simple in a way. I have loved my job and the many roles I've held since I entered education 18 years ago.&nbsp; But I have always struggled with how little the larger educational system has changed in those years, let alone the past century.&nbsp; The world is changing, technology is changing and students are following suit.&nbsp; It's time for the educational system to start serving the modern student.*

###### Besides your specialty, what other talents and interests do you want to share with our community?

*I grew up around power tools and constant construction. I love it. I'm passionate about newer technologies and my love for learning new things has pushed me into virtual reality, augmented reality and (hopefully soon) coding and programming.&nbsp; However, if I couldn't teach, I'd want to be a chef and run a restaurant or food truck.&nbsp; It's a creative, scientific, community-oriented endeavor.&nbsp; I'd love to help kids who are interested in the same world.*

###### What previous life experiences are you bringing to the Compass Community?

*I grew up in a family that has a strong conservative side and a strong progressive side.&nbsp; I love reading and listening to multiple perspectives on issues, thoughtfully debating them (considering the implications of each argument) and coming to a resolution when possible.&nbsp; This is difficult for anyone, including me.&nbsp; But it's so rewarding when it happens.*

At certain points in my life, I've struggled with severe physical illness and personal struggles (including depression and PTSD).&nbsp; Because of this, I recognize that everyone has underlying struggles and challenges.&nbsp; I want to listen, empathize and support all students.

###### What is your dream project/partnership at Compass?

*I'd love to open a food truck business (with a local chef/entrepreneur), throw a "parking lot bbq fundraiser" (with a friend of mine who owns a bbq restaurant) utilizing student-designed, human-powered spits and BIG fires, or design, build and run a high-level haunted house focused on historical events during Halloween (with local historians and contractors).*

###### What do you believe?

*I believe life is short; don't waste it.*

###### What are five things that you know to be true?

1. *Family is all that really matters (both the one you are born into and the ones you create.*

2. Our youth have the power to solve today's biggest problems.&nbsp; They just need a chance to figure out.

3. Play is essential.

4. Failure is important.

5. Ice cream tastes better when you eat it with the little taster spoon.

###### What is one question that you are still searching for an answer to?

*Why can't we all just get along?*

###### What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?

*The Chicago Cubs winning the World Series in 2016 (not really MY accomplishment)*

*Creating an amazing life with my favorite person in the world and having 2 beautiful little girls (that sounds better)*

###### If you could wake up tomorrow with one new quality or ability, what would it be?

*I'd love to speak fluent Spanish or be a great piano player.*

###### For what in your life do you feel the most grateful?

*Self-awareness, constant learning and personal growth*

###### What would constitute a "perfect day"?

*Waking up late, drinking coffee on the deck, being lazy with my family, doing something that makes me feel creative and having a fantastic meal that an amazing chef makes for us. &nbsp;*
