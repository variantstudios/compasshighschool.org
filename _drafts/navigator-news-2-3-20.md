# ****FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics Wins Awards at Regionals\!****

****![](/assets/images/a-winning-team.jpg){: width="1000" height="808"}****

*****A winning team\!*****

&nbsp;

Our upper school robotics team earned a 2nd place THINK award and 3rd place CONTROL award in this past weekend’s regional competition\!&nbsp;

The THINK award is given to teams for removing engineering obstacles through creative thinking. This judged award is given to the team that best reflects the journey the team took as they experienced the engineering design process during the build season. The engineering content within the notebook is the key reference for Judges to help identify the most deserving team. The team’s engineering content must focus on the design and build stage of the team’s robot. Journal entries should include descriptions of the underlying science and mathematics of the robot design and game strategies, the designs, redesigns, successes, and opportunities for improvement. The Control Award celebrates a team that uses sensors and software to increase the robot’s functionality in the field. This award is given to the team that demonstrates innovative thinking to solve game challenges such as autonomous operation, improving mechanical systems with intelligent control, or using sensors to achieve better results. The control component should work consistently in the field.&nbsp;

This diverse team of students practiced a multitude of engineering and collaboration skills as they designed, built, programmed, and competed in a head-to-head robot challenge. Additionally, they created an engineering notebook that documented their learning and worked through the challenges of team work over the course of many long hours in school, after school, and on the weekends during the last several months. Congratulations to Alex, Zander, Mitchell, Cameron, Lydia, June, Owen, and Brenden for their creativity and hard work\! Congratulations and lots of gratitude to Dawn DuPriest for being their selfless and dedicated coach throughout the season\!

# ****CSU College of Business Global Business Academy for High School Students****

&nbsp;

***From our partners at Colorado State University ...***The third summer CSU Global Business Academy is accepting for applications from current high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors. If you know a high school student who might benefit from a two-week, interactive and team-based program where they develop global business awareness, cross-cultural skills, and form new international friendships&nbsp;[please see our website](https://biz.colostate.edu/academics/high-school-programs/global-business-academy){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for more information and the application link.

**Here’s what some of last year’s attendees said:**

*“In such a short time, I learned how the world around me works.&nbsp; I learned about finance, marketing, and supply chains. My favorite thing about camp was meeting people from all over the world\!&nbsp; GBA opened my mind and expanded my horizons. I feel more confident talking to people and talking about business.”*&nbsp;<br>–Kate, Colorado

*“GBA is definitely not a walk in the park, but the people you meet, connections you make, and knowledge you gain is indefinitely rewarding.”*<br>– Anonymous, GBA 2019 student

*“I have learned many important notions about business, accounting, marketing, but most importantly about myself and my personal worth.&nbsp; I have learned to that to be a good leader it is not enough to be clever and a quick-learner, it is also necessary to be capable of listening, understanding other people’s point of view and finding a compromise.”*<br>–Valentina, Italy

# Report From the Field

![](/assets/images/kayla-s-venture-travelled-to-the-lincoln-center-to-plan-for-their-performance-space.jpg){: width="1600" height="929"}

—By Tyler W.On Wednesday of last week, Kayla's venture (1st Annual Compass Performance Showcase) went to the&nbsp;[Fort Collins Lincoln Center](https://lctix.com/){: target="_blank"}. We learned how to walk through the building, what the rules were and where everything we will need for our performance is located. We also learned about the history of the center.&nbsp;***Did you know the Lincoln Center is named after the high school that was there before?***

**Kayla's venture is performing in the Magnolia Theater on February 26 from 2:00 to 3:00 pm.**&nbsp;We hope you will be there\! We will be taking donations and then giving them to&nbsp;[Dance Express](http://www.danceexpressfc.com/){: target="_blank"}. Dance Express is a company that gives everyone a chance no matter race, gender, disability, or age to dance. Our mission is to produce a unique show with a variety of talents that is a unifying experience for all.
