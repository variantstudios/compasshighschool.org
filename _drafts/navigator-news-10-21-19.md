What a Night\!
{: .cta}

Our first Exhibition of Learning of the year was a great success\! From sustainability to robotics, and plant restoration to self-exploration, it is clear that much learning is happening at Compass. Students confidently explained their work to adultsâ€”an important skill that will serve them well no matter what their futures hold\! Thank you all for coming out and being a part of our vibrant community of learners. Enjoy this recap of the exhibition in pictures\!
