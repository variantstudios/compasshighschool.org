Community Collaboration:
{: .cta}

**Recently, a group of middle-school aged Compass students got to flip traditional roles, and act as the panel of advisors for women in the STEM fields!&nbsp;**[Expanding Your Horizons](https://www.eyhn.org/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;(EYH) is a national network that hosts one-day conferences to encourage young women to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers.

In preparation for their annual conference at CSU on April 6 from 9a-3p (have middle school girls? Mark your calendars and&nbsp;[sign up here](http://nocoeyh.wixsite.com/home){: target="_blank"}),EYH invited a panel of our students to evaluate their ideas for projects that would be engaging for middle school students. Were Compass students intimidated by being in the spotlight in front of neuroscientists, coders, and geneticists? No!**&nbsp;Our students showed true poise, and responded to ideas with true insight and thoughtful comments. We are so proud of you!**

**Hi, my name is Tristan Phegley and I am in my fourth and final year at Colorado State University studying Human Development & Family Studies**with a double concentration in Prevention & Intervention Sciences and Leadership & Entrepreneurial Professions. I am currently interning at Compass Community Collaborative School.&nbsp;**I often help tutor in math, science, English, and other areas as well.**&nbsp;Within the next few weeks, I will be leading a basketball seminar, where I will be teaching students about the game of basketball along with having a little bit of fun playing basketball outside! If you see me around, feel free to say “hi” and ask any questions you may have.&nbsp;

Seminar Spotlight

**The&nbsp;*Girls in the Spotlight*&nbsp;eight-week seminar**&nbsp;was designed to give girls an opportunity to&nbsp;**develop and strengthen public speaking skills through communication arts**&nbsp;(speech and drama.) The seminar gives each girl an opportunity every week to speak in a supportive girl-centric environment. All seminars include a warmup, presentation time, a peer review and a retrospective mindful circle. Emphasis is placed on the voice being a powerful tool, communicating with facial expressions and gestures and exploring:

* Impromptu speech
* Pantomime
* Storytelling
* Folktales
* Public speaking

Each week the girls have opportunity to fill a variety of seminar leadership roles and can lead the warmups should they desire. The seminar concludes with a culminating peer showcase and the potential to create a podcast.&nbsp;**The seminar is lead by Hope Hartman, founder of Escape Velocity and Executive Director of Girls in the Spotlight Foundation.**&nbsp;Thank you Hope, for helping Compass continue to be an amazing place to learn.
