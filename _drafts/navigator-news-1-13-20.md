# Reflections on Presentations of Learning

***From a Compass parent:***&nbsp;“I wanted to email you and thank you for the great opportunity all the students had to present their Presentations of Learning to their parents and groups.&nbsp; My daughter worked so hard on her presentation - that is the hardest I've seen her work in years. Some of it was motivated by fear of public speaking, and reaching her time limit, and in the end she did a great job and was very proud of herself.&nbsp; Public speaking is hard for most adults, and I'm so impressed with the way the students tackled their fears and embraced this learning assignment. Thanks for pushing them outside of their comfort zones\!” &nbsp;

***From a Compass Board member:***&nbsp;“Thanks for having me sit in on student presentations\! They were all so incredible. I am thankful to be part of such an impactful organization in Fort Collins. Compass is truly making the world a better place.”
