{: .cta}

![](/assets/images/img-0247.jpg)

Thanks to all of you for your flexibility regarding the rescheduled *Exhibition of Learning* before spring break! The blizzard was inconveniently timed, to be sure. For those of you who were able to rearrange your schedules, you got to see powerful evidence of learning from students in all of the venture projects:

* **Whimsical Inventions** included everything from 3-D printed and programmed LED light up gadgets to a radio-controlled jelly bean launcher
* **Pollinator Gardens** project included bat homes, bee hotels, and planted container gardens (Thank you to our partners at [City of Fort Collins](https://www.fcgov.com/){: target="_blank"}!)
* **Rocky Mountain Environmental Challenge Flood Mitigation Design Challenge** presented their research and design proposals (Thank you to our partner [Earth Force](https://earthforce.org/rmec/){: target="_blank"})
* **Understanding the Impact of Technology**, included artifacts of the National Unplug Day that students in this venture hosted for Compass
* **Individual venture projects** included stunning art projects on endangered and extinct species created by Sarah Parry and Ocean Griffis-West and an "eye contact experience" hosted by others in the group
* **Human Rights Violations** "museum" explored both human rights violations and human rights heros in a powerfully curated experience
* **Community Theater** - *Common Grounds*, a funny and insightful play written by a young, local playwright, was directed, costumed, staged, and acted by Kayla's venture project on Tuesday evening and Thursday morning
* **Dance Club** created a performance art piece that they performed during Exhibition
