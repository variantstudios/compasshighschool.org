**On Thursday April 4th, five students from Compass presented their third quarter venture project as part of a competition put on by Federal Emergency Management Agency and Earth Force**, the Denver-based nonprofit with whom Sam Gleeson’s students partnered in designing flood mitigation and emergency preparedness projects.

**One of our student team's project proposed making changes to a median in the Compass parking lot to act as a storm water filter.&nbsp;**By using plants and soil to capture the pollutants in the the stormwater from the Whole Foods parking lot and keeping it from running across our parking lot, the student’s design aimed to keep pollution from entering the Spring Creek Watershed.

The competition was held at the Poudre School District Board Room, and our students sat right up front, fully engaged in the four hour experience, and gave a terrific presentation. Their effort and maturity with the project was a notable example of the skills we want all Compass students to be able to demonstrate.**Oh, and did we mention that they won $400?\! Congratulations to Ruby, Tyler, Savannah, Jadan, and Matthew\!**

By participating in Deeper Learning, our amazing educators are tapped into movement to transform education—and we are excited that Compass is at the heart of that change\!
