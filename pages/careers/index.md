# Careers

&nbsp;

Are you a trailblazer, observer, visionary, and innovator ready to discover learning with purpose alongside a team of students? We are. And we are looking for creative, curious, student-centered educators to join our team. We believe in place-based education that shifts learning out of the traditional classroom setting and puts kids into the community ready to share their unique genius to be positive change-makers in the world.

We opened in August 2018, serving a diverse population of 150 students in grades 6-10 from around Fort Collins. We will grow to include 200 students in grades 6-12 over the next two years. Employing a transdisciplinary, venture project-based curriculum with support from our national educational partners, Big Picture Learning and No Barriers Youth, we inspire thoughtful and creative problem-solvers who aspire to live with integrity and compassion. We explicitly teach and help them practice the skills that will help them thrive in a rapidly changing world. Our entrepreneurial teaching methods prepare students to think deeply, design creatively, and iterate mindfully, while achieving at the highest academic levels.

Compass Community Collaborative is dedicated to personalized, competency-based learning to help all students discover learning with purpose, to author the best story of their lives and our collective future.
