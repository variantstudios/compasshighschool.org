### FUTURE COMPASS STUDENTS

We are only accepting applications for potential admission one year in advance. If you have a student who would like to join Compass for the 2021-2022 school year (or beyond), kindly check back in August of next year. We run admissions based on a randomized lottery, so joining the waitlist later does not impact your chances of acceptance.&nbsp;

***PLEASE NOTE:*** Applications for potential admission DO NOT ROLLOVER from year to year. This means that if you have previously submitted an application for admission, and are currently waitlisted, YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT A NEW APPLICATION for the coming school year to be entered into the pre-lottery pool, and thus, to be eligible for potential admission to Compass for the next school year.
