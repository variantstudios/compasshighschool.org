# Admissions

### 2019-2020 SCHOOL YEAR

We are currently accepting applications for potential admission to Compass for the 2019-2020 school year for students in grades 6-10. *If you would like to join our waitlist, please apply using the link below.*

[Apply Now](https://applytocompassfortcollins.com/login){: target="_blank"}.

### FUTURE COMPASS STUDENTS

We are only accepting applications for potential admission one year in advance. If you have a student who would like to join Compass for the 2020-2021 school year (or beyond), kindly check back in August of next year (or beyond:)\! We run admissions based on a lottery, so joining the waitlist later does not impact your chances of acceptance.
