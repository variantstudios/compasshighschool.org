# A Day in the Life

![](/assets/images/day-in-the-life.png)

At Compass, our schedule is different from traditional schools in line with our innovative educational model. We emphasize flexibility, as follows:&nbsp;

* Start times: Families choose one of three start times with a corresponding end time. This lets teens get the sleep they need, and helps bring studentâ€™s schedules more in line with family needs.
* Individualization: Compass students have individualized mathematics and English instruction with [Summit Learning Platform](https://www.summitlearning.org/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;at the beginning and/or end of the day.&nbsp; Certified teachers provide personal support during this academic time.
* Flexible learning time: We don't use a traditional bell schedule at schedule. Instead, students have large, flexible blocks of time that allow them to make the most of their [Venture Projects](/venture-projects/).&nbsp; This facilitates cooperation with our community partners, and give students plenty of time for advanced learning on CSU's campus, on-site seminars and off-site internships.&nbsp;
