At Compass, our schedule is different to facilitate our innovative educational model.

* Families choose one of three start times with a corresponding end time. This lets teens get the sleep they need, and helps bring studentâ€™s schedules more in line with family needs.
* Compass students have individualized mathematics and English instruction with Summit Learning Platform at the beginning and/or end of the day. Certified teachers are always available for personal coaching.
* Large, flexible blocks of time allow for students to make the most of their Venture Projects. The longer blocks of time facilitates cooperation with our community partners, and allows plenty of time for college courses and internships.
