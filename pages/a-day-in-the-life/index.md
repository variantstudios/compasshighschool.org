At Compass, our schedule is different to facilitate our innovative educational model. &nbsp;
{: .align-to-right}

1. Families choose one of three start times with a corresponding end time. &nbsp;This lets teens get the sleep they need, and helps bring student’s schedules more in line with family needs.{: .align-to-right}
2. Compass students have individualized mathematics and English instruction with Summit Learning Platform at the beginning and/or end of the day. &nbsp;Certified teachers are always available for personal coaching.{: .align-to-right}
3. Large, flexible blocks of time allow for students to make the most of their Venture Projects. &nbsp;The longer blocks of time facilitates cooperation with our community partners, and allows plenty of time for college courses and internships.{: .align-to-right}
