## Parents get to play a part!

It is our belief that welcoming and partnering with families is part of what will make our climate and culture exceptional. Parents know the value of a great education for their children. It is our goal to help your child thrive in a school environment that is tailored to build on their strengths and passions.

All new students will complete an interview and skills assessment to make sure our staff will effectively meet the needs of each individual as they create their learning plan.

We want your involvement and partnership in our school. In addition to being a participant in the students’ three times/year Presentations of Learning (student led conferences), we hope you will help us connect students to internships in the community. Additionally, we will also welcome families to evening classes to learn English, computer skills, and tricks of the trade in the difficult job of parenting adolescents. We value your role as a parent and want to be an extension of your encouragement for your child to be a powerful, positive change maker in our community and our world.
