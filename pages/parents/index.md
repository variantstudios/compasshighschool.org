# Parents

## Parents get to play a part!

It is our belief that welcoming and partnering with families is part of what makes our climate and culture exceptional. Parents know the value of a great education for their children. Our goal is to help your child thrive in a school environment that is tailored to build on their strengths and passions.

All new students complete an interview and skills assessment to make sure our staff can effectively meet the needs of each individual as they create their learning plan.

We want your involvement and partnership in our school. In addition to being a participant in the studentsâ€™ three times/year Presentations of Learning (student-led conferences), we welcome your help in connecting students to internships in the community. Additionally, we also invite families to evening classes to learn English, computer skills, and tricks of the trade in the difficult job of parenting adolescents. Other classes and opportunities for parents and families will be created on a year-by-year basis in response to family needs and interests. We value your role as a parent and want to be an extension of your encouragement for your child to be a powerful, positive change maker in our community and our world.
