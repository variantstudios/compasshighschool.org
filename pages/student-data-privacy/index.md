We strive to collect only enough information to comply with mandatory state and federal reports and to provide educational services to our students.<br><br>To review the data elements collected and submitted to the Colorado Department of Education as part of our required state reporting, please visit the&nbsp;[CDE Data Portal](http://www.eddataportal.info/cde){: target="_blank"}.<br><br>CCC is currently working to provide a list of data elements containing PII above and beyond the information collected by the Colorado Department of Education. That list will be available in the Fall of 2018.
