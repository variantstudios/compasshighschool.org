# CCCS Student Data Privacy Policy

### STUDENT DATA PRIVACY

Toward this end, CCCS utilizes a variety of websites and web-based applications to deliver and supplement curriculum, teach 21st century skills, provide interventions, measure progress, and conduct business.<br><br>Safeguarding education data is of utmost importance to CCCS.

### PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)

Student Personally Identifiable Information is data that, alone or in combination, personally identifies an individual student or the student's parent or family.<br><br>CCCS collects and maintains PII via information provided by the parent/guardian (usually at registration or annual information verification) or based on student performance (usually in the form of scores and grades (e.g., report cards and transcripts)). We strive to collect only enough information to comply with mandatory state and federal reports and to provide educational services to our students.<br><br>To review the data elements collected and submitted to the Colorado Department of Education as part of our required state reporting, please visit the&nbsp;[CDE Data Portal](http://www.eddataportal.info/cde){: target="_blank"}.<br><br>CCCS is currently working to provide a list of data elements containing PII above and beyond the information collected by the Colorado Department of Education. That list will be available in the Fall of 2018.
