## Our Team

Compass Community Collaborative School is being designed by a diverse team of educators, students, artists, and community leaders in the entrepreneurial business hub of Fort Collins.

These influencers are passionate about embedding secondary education into real-world problem solving and meaningful work. Teachers will work collaboratively with community partners on school ventures, teach content area focused seminars, guide independent online work, and also serve as coaches and mentors to each other.

&nbsp;

We have a team of over 50 active volunteers and the ranks are growing by the week. You are invited to join the fun (oh, and did we mention this is hard work, too?)
