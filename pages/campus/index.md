# Campus

## Classrooms, cafeterias, and hallways lined with lockers?

Just as Compass Community Collaborative doesn't feel like any school in Fort Collins, it doesn't look like any school in town either. Open, flexible spaces, and a kitchen for cooking healthy food will support our students, staff, and community partners.

When we were designing our building, Colorado State University’s Dr. Laura Malinin’s &nbsp;senior interior design students helped us dream big, and then, once we committed to 2105 S. College Ave. as our home, Vaught, Frye, Larson Architects started working on the floor plan below. This design was the starting point for the building you see today!&nbsp;

But don’t forget, we are a Community Collaborative, which means we are not limited to one building; all of Fort Collins is our campus! This illustration gives you a good sense of where our “home base” is in relation to our current community partners, and note that we are at a MAX line bus stop which will facilitate easy access to CSU campus and all of our community partners throughout the school year.
