Classrooms, cafeterias, and hallways lined with lockers?

Just like Compass High will not “act” like any school in Fort Collins, it won’t look like any school in town either. Open, flexible spaces, and a kitchen for cooking healthy food will support our students, staff, and community partners.

We are grateful to Davis & Davis Architects for creating these drawings so that you can see what we can see in our near future!
