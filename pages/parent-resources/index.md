# Parent Resources

### TRANSPORTATION

Compass purposely chose a building that was centrally located and linked to our public transportation system in Fort Collins.&nbsp; If possible, public transportation should be your primary choice for sending your Compass student to our school.

* BIKE: We are right next to the&nbsp;[Spring Creek bike trail](https://www.fcgov.com/bicycling/pdf/bike-map-front.pdf){: target="_blank"}. which connects most of Fort Collins.
* BUS: We are adjacent to the Spring Creek&nbsp;[MAX](http://www.ridetransfort.com/max){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;station.&nbsp; Take the MAX from home to school, connect through other&nbsp;[TRANSFORT](http://www.ridetransfort.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;routes, or consider parking at a northern or southern MAX stop and have your student ride to the Spring Creek Max station to arrive to school within minutes. Youth age 17 and under ride the MAX for free!
* CAR: We realize that there are times you will be driving your student to school.&nbsp; Because of the close proximity of our school to neighboring businesses, please understand that traffic congestion for those parents who choose to drive their student to our school will be expected.&nbsp; Please know that students will **not be allowed to drive**&nbsp;themselves to Compass.&nbsp;
