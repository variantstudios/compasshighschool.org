# Parent Resources

## TRANSPORTATION

Compass purposely chose a building that was centrally located and linked to our public transportation system in Fort Collins.&nbsp; Whenever possible, public transportation should be your primary method for sending your Compass student to our school.

* BIKE: We are right next to the&nbsp;[Spring Creek bike trail](https://www.fcgov.com/bicycling/pdf/bike-map-front.pdf){: target="_blank"}. which connects most of Fort Collins.
* BUS: We are adjacent to the Spring Creek&nbsp;[MAX](http://www.ridetransfort.com/max){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;station.&nbsp; Take the MAX from home to school, connect through other&nbsp;[TRANSFORT](http://www.ridetransfort.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;routes, or consider parking at a northern or southern MAX stop and have your student ride to the Spring Creek Max station to arrive to school within minutes. Students age 17 and under ride the MAX for free\!
* CAR: We realize that there are times you will be driving your student to our school.&nbsp; Because of the close proximity of our school to neighboring businesses, please understand that traffic congestion for those parents who choose to drive their student to our school will be expected.&nbsp; Also understand that students are not allowed to park on campus or in neighboring parking lots. MAX stops are a great way for students to drive themselves and arrive on campus.

## MEALS

Compass has a closed campus for lunch time. Students can bring their own home-prepared lunch but we also have a unique option for students and parents when considering lunch. We have partnered with [**Wholesome Food Services**](https://www.wholesomefoodservices.com/){: target="_blank"}to deliver a variety of fresh, nutritious and delicious lunches to our students on site daily.&nbsp; Wholesome Food Services began as a grassroots effort of parents and nutrition experts in Colorado to offer a unique school lunch program providing great lunch options for students and staff as well as a comprehensive lunch program administration for schools. Their mission is to provide real, fresh food choices for students and staff. They offer the highest quality food choices and provide delicious, healthy options that kids love at reasonable prices.

Wholesome Food Services provides lunches created with high quality ingredients including gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian and organic where available. Orders can be placed just a day at a time, or up to two months ahead.&nbsp;**Online Ordering** with secure credit card processing provides a turn-key convenience for schools and parents.

We sincerely believe that our common, shared lunchtime, on our campus, is a perfect time to build strong relationships between students and staff as we eat, laugh, talk and play together each day. Plus, we believe in including the students in the work of recycling, composting, and keeping our campus clean and beautiful. Our common, shared lunchtime also allows for special celebrations, presentations, and whole-school conversations.

## THE SCIENCE BEHIND COMPASS
