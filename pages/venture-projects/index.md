## The CCC Difference

Individualized, community-engaged learning is at the heart of the Compass Community Collaborative School difference. Our model puts students in the driver’s seat of creating work that matters to them and their community, while challenging them to apply their knowledge and creativity across many subjects.

Each school year students will complete at least eight ventures (two per quarter), which are deep academic explorations with real world applications. These may be a combination of teacher-designed, student-designed, and community-inspired ventures. All will be interdisciplinary and will meet the state academic standards for a variety of core disciplines, including art, health, and physical education. &nbsp;Additionally, students will practice mathematics and English skill development daily, showing progress through their online learning platform (Summit Learning Systems) and &nbsp;MAP testing three times per year. Students will be challenged to continuously reflect on their mastery of the eight Compass Competencies (future ready skills) as well as Colorado and international academic standards. Presentations of Learning (student led conferences) will be evaluated by the student’s 360 team three times per year, but students will be given regular feedback over the course of each venture. Twice a year students &nbsp;and staff will host public Exhibitions of Learning.

Newer students will work in and around the school and will choose from among teacher-led ventures to develop the skills to manage their learning. Experienced CCC students who have demonstrated required academic and skill competencies will take the lead in designing ventures, take college classes, and &nbsp;intern with local businesses in career fields in which they are interested.

## Community Partner Projects

Additional ways that we are breaking down barriers between school and community include our monthly Community Conclaves and our monthly “Lunch and Learn” programs. Compass will host “lunch and learn” presentations on various topics of interest to students and their families and these events will be open to the public. The Community Conclaves will be special evening events in which businesses, students, and citizens with ideas for Compass ventures, or particular problems they are concerned about solving, can pitch their ideas to the Compass community to develop opportunities for collaboration.
