Welcome to the Compass Parent Action Council (PAC). We are delighted that you are interested in getting involved as a parent member within the Compass community. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with our Mission and all that PAC aims to offer and has to offer!

### Mission

*The Compass Community Collaborative School Parent Action Council (PAC) is a volunteer organization, whose objective is to enhance the school experience for the students of Compass Community Collaborative School. Through the PAC, parents work together to enrich the educational and social environment of CCC.*

### *Committees*

At the heart of PAC are its committees. This is where we roll up our sleeves and make great stuff happen for our school. If you excel at event planning, we have need of you! If youâ€™d like to treat our hard-working Compass staff to coffee and doughnuts, we need you! If you can lend a hand when you are able, we have need of you! Simply decide where you would like to contribute and email [pac@compassfortcollins.org](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org). You will be put in touch with the appropriate committee.
