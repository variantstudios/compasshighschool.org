### Mission

*The Compass Community Collaborative School Parent Action Council (PAC) is a volunteer organization, whose objective is to enhance the school experience for the students of Compass Community Collaborative School.

Simply decide where you would like to contribute and email [pac@compassfortcollins.org](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org). You will be put in touch with the appropriate committee.
