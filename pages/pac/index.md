# Compass Parent Action Council (PAC)

Welcome to the Compass Parent Action Council (PAC). We are delighted that you are interested in getting involved as a parent member within the Compass community. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with our Mission and all that PAC aims to offer.

### Mission

*The Compass Community Collaborative School Parent Action Council (PAC) is a parent volunteer organization, whose objective is to enhance the school experience for the students of Compass Community Collaborative School (CCC). Through the PAC, parents work together to enrich the educational and social environment of CCC.*

### **Meetings**

PAC meetings are held the **first Monday of every month\*** at Compass.<br>6:30-7:00p PAC Business Meeting<br>7:00-8:00p PAC Parent Education<br>*\*Unless this day falls on a No School Day or Holiday*

### Arms of the PAC

1. **Student Support:** These parents are liaisons to the student community and assist in enriching the student experience. This could include coordinating social activities, finding community connections students are in need of, etc. If students need help sourcing supplies, manpower or funding, they can make a call to these members of the PAC for assistance.
2. **Culture:** Enriching and bringing the Compass community together through; Staff Appreciation, Parent Education, After Hours Socials, etc.
3. **Fundraising:** Not to be confused with Development, funds raised by the PAC go to support PAC initiatives (student needs, events, etc). See below for ongoing passive fundraisers.&nbsp;
4. **Communications:** Responsible for PAC newsletters and email, facilitating PAC meetings, and managing the PAC Facebook group page.

### **Executing Our Mission**

In a way true to our school’s approach to learning, the PAC takes a collaborative approach to executing its mission. ALL Compass parents/caregivers are welcome to be a part of the PAC and attend its meetings. **These monthly meetings are the forum for presenting updates on PAC events/projects/activities and where new ideas may be pitched.** If an idea is deemed a “go” *by the parents in attendance*, the green light is given and a Parent Coordinator is assigned to execute all facets of the task (pulling in other parent volunteers as needed).

### **Are You a Project Coordinator?**

Please [email](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org?subject=Agenda%20Item)&nbsp;items you want included in the next PAC Meeting Agenda by the Thursday PRIOR to the PAC meeting. If you are unable to attend and have an update to share, [email](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org?subject=Agenda%20Item) the Communications Coordinator by the Thursday prior. A reminder will be sent out to all Project Coordinators in advance. If at any time a Project Coordinator needs to get a message out (email, social media, etc), he/she simply contacts the&nbsp;[Communication Coordinator](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org)—preferably providing 48 hours advance notice.

### Passive Fundraising

Funds raised by PAC are used to supplement PAC-sponsored events for students and parents as well as for the needs of the school. Passive fundraisers are the easiest way to “give” and require little effort. Three such fundraisers we participate in are Caps4Cash, BoxTops and King Soopers Reloadable Gift Cards.

**Morning Fresh Caps4Cash + BoxTops:&nbsp;**Squirrel away Morning Fresh Dairy milk caps and cut out those Box Tops for Education and bring them in to the front office where we have a collection bins for them. Please neatly trim box tops, ensuring date on box top is not cut off nor expired.

**King Soopers Reloadable Card:&nbsp;**Earnings from this program add up fast!! When using a Compass reloadable King Soopers gift card, 5% of your King Soopers grocery and fuel purchases go to Compass. To give you an idea; if 20 families spent $800 per month for 12 months, that would amount to $9,600 for the year! All you need to do is pick up a card from the front office. They have been pre-loaded with $2.50. Before checking out, load your card with enough to pay for your groceries. Many of us guesstimate, or you may load up to $500. Proceed with checking out and use the loaded gift card to complete the purchase. Easy!
