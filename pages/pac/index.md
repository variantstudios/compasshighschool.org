# Compass Parent Action Council (PAC)

Welcome to the Compass Parent Action Council (PAC). We are delighted that you are interested in being involved as a parent member of the Compass community. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with our Mission and all that PAC aims to offer.

### Mission

The Compass Community Collaborative School Parent Action Council (PAC) is a parent volunteer organization whose objective is to **enrich school culture and the student experience.**

### Meetings

PAC meetings are held the **first Monday of every month\*** at Compass.<br>6:30-7:00p PAC Business Meeting<br>7:00-8:00p PAC Parent Education<br>*\*Unless this day falls on a No School Day or Holiday*

### What We Do

Are you a parent or guardian eager to help build Compass community and culture? PAC can always use Parent Coordinators to help&nbsp;**coordinate educational and social activities and events** (student socials, staff appreciation gestures, parent education, after-hours socials, community service outings, etc). We also do a wee bit of fundraising to help fund for the activities mentioned above.

### Executing Our Mission

In a way true to our school’s approach to learning, the PAC takes a collaborative approach to executing its mission. ALL Compass parents/guardians are welcome to be a part of the PAC and attend its meetings. **These monthly meetings are a forum for planning and presenting updates on PAC events/projects/activities.** If an idea is deemed a “go” *by the parents in attendance*, the green light is given and a *Parent Coordinator* is assigned to execute all facets of the task (pulling in other parent volunteers as needed).

### Are You a Parent Coordinator?

Please [email](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org?subject=Agenda%20Item)&nbsp;items you want included in the next PAC Meeting Agenda by the Thursday PRIOR to the PAC meeting. If you are unable to attend and have an update to share, [email](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org?subject=Agenda%20Item) the Communications Coordinator by the Thursday prior. If at any time a Parent Coordinator needs to get a message out, he/she simply contacts the&nbsp;[Communications Coordinator](mailto:pac@compassfortcollins.org)—preferably providing 48 hours advance notice.

### Passive Fundraising

Funds raised by PAC are used to supplement school and PAC activities. Passive fundraisers are the easiest way to “give” and require little effort. Three such fundraisers we participate in areCaps4Cash, BoxTops and the King Soopers Community Rewards Program.
