## New Partnerships

Compass High School is continually developing new partnerships with business, nonprofit, artistic, college, university, and government entities to provide our students the opportunities to engage in meaningful career exploration and for our community to benefit from the energy and commitment of young people in their work environments.

We have a great deal of flexibility in arranging internships with our community partners. Inviting startups to share in co-working spaces in our school building, and having our students working collaboratively with businesses around Fort Collins means we have a great deal of flexibility in partnering with community members.

We are creating a small learning community where every student and family is known and valued, and equity and wellness are foundational to our high expectations of one another. Our schedule will support this goal and students will work in the local and global community as much as they work in the school building. Fort Collinsâ€™ business, nonprofit, artistic, and university partners are uniquely positioned to engage our students in meaningful project-based learning and internships. Celebrating our deepest values of inclusiveness, empathy, gratitude, hard work, and responsibility will be the waypoints by which we will navigate and sustain the development of our school culture.
