The results are in for the No Barriers 2019 [Wells Fargo Global Impact Challenge](https://www.nobarriersyouth.org/wells-global-impact-challenge/)—a diversity and inclusion competition designed to spark the best ideas from students for building a world free of barriers, stereotypes and discrimination.

### **2019 RESULTS**

Two&nbsp;**first-place teams**&nbsp;were awarded $5,000 to implement their projects and invited to present at the 2020 No Barriers Summit on Sept. 18 in San Francisco:

●&nbsp;*Compass Community Collaborative School*, Fort Collins, Colo., included 15 students led by Bonnie Cowen. The team focused on creating a curriculum, by teens for teens that addresses mental health education in schools.

●&nbsp;*North Windy Ridge Intermediate*, Weaverville, N.C., included eight students led by teacher Jeremy Aten. The team focused on destigmatizing ADHD in their school and developing programs to help those students succeed.

Two&nbsp;**runner-up teams**&nbsp;were awarded $1,500 to implement their projects:

●&nbsp;*Disability Network of Northern Michigan*, Grayling, Mich., included five students led by teachers Kristen Conrad and Caitlin Chlosta. The team focused on developing a program for youth in lock-up to make community connections and discover passions to help positively fill free time once they transition back into the community.

●&nbsp;*Conrad Ball Middle School*, Loveland, Colo., included 18 students led by teacher Andrew Hinerfeld. The team focused on creating a space within their school where students who deal with sensory overload can go to reset and recalibrate in order to succeed.
