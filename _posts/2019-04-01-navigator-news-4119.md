**Hello! My name is Leah,** I am a current student at CSU studying math and Spanish. **I am planning to pursue a career as a high school math teacher.**In my free time, I enjoy hiking and camping with my cat (yes, cat!) and I also train rescue horses. I have loved spending time at Compass learning from the awesome staff and students!

**Hi, I’m Laura,** I am a senior at CSU and will be graduating in May! I am studying Human Development and Family Studies with concentrations in both early childhood education and intervention and prevention sciences. **I have a passion for working with students and watching them grow.** I love being outdoors and spending time with my family, friends, and dogs! My time at Compass has been amazing and I can’t wait to continue learning from the students and staff for the rest of the semester!
