February is an interesting time of year. It is dark and cold, but the days are getting noticeably longer. We are fully engaged in this school year, but actively preparing for the next.

Many of our older students are starting to feel the tug of transition as well. They are looking ahead to what lies beyond high school. **We held our first *Compass College Planning Night* last week and it was a great success!** We had an excellent turnout to hear from Jason, Jenny, and myself about the unique ways in which Compass students are being prepared for life after high school. **Diane Campbell, from Campbell College Consulting, presented an excellent overview of the college search, application, and financing strategies that will empower students to make the best choices in their college search.** We will be partnering with families over the next two years to ensure that our students thrive in their post-secondary lives. It is exciting to think that two years from now we will be preparing to celebrate our first Compass graduates! &nbsp;

In the meantime, the school is buzzing with energy and learning, **our student re-enrollment rate for next year is over 96%, and more families are joining our waitlist by the day.** Compass is thriving, and we are grateful for your partnership in this exciting journey!

**Abi T. and Brenden D. are working as teaching assistants and simultaneously on an independent design project this quarter as part of the *Whimsical Inventions Venture Project.*** They have a limited budget to work with, and they've been sketching, planning, and prototyping already. They have in mind some parts to order and trips to the [Creator Hub](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=fb74183548&amp;e=46f52667a0) to do some machiningâ€”but before they enter the build phase of their project, **they have conducted a formal "Design Review" checkpoint with their teacher, Dawn, two community members from the Creator Hub and a few staff members.** The goal at the design review was to make sure their planning is in a good place so they can order parts and build. This is design thinking and community collaboration in action, and we are proud of these students and the excellent guidance they are getting from their teacher!
