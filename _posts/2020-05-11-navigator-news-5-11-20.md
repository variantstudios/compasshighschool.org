# **Compass's First Graduate Earns Scholarships and Offers to Eight Colleges and Universities**

![](/assets/images/mia-anderson-is-compass--first-graduate--congratulations-mia.jpg){: width="1000" height="1333"}

**Mia Anderson joined Compass as a Sophomore when we opened our school in August of 2018. She quickly stood out as a leader and fully embraced all the opportunities our model offers.&nbsp;**

Mia jumped right into leadership roles, she created her own Venture Projects, and earned an internship with [No Barriers](https://nobarriersusa.org) where she was reported to have been the*&nbsp;“best intern they have ever had”*&nbsp;(and this is in a field where their interns are usually college students or college graduates\!).&nbsp;

Conserve School in northern Wisconsin for this spring semester of her junior year. As the leap to the Conserve school approached, **Mia decided that she also wanted to take advantage of her hard work and stellar preparation to graduate early from high school and go to college** to deepen her studies and broaden her experiences.&nbsp;

**Mia was accepted at Prescott College, University of Montana, Western Colorado University, Fort Lewis College, Quest University, Evergreen State College, and College of the Atlantic, and was offered over $94,000 in merit scholarships\!&nbsp;**We are so proud of her\! In August, Mia will be representing Compass Community Collaborative School as a freshman at&nbsp;**[Prescott College](https://prescott.edu){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;in Arizona**, and we know that she will continue to shine as she&nbsp;*“authors the best possible story of her life and our collective futures*\!" Congratulations, Mia\!

# Rocky Mountain Environmental Hazards Challenge Winners\!

**Serving our community by working on real world problems is foundational to Compass Community Collaborative School.&nbsp;****Congratulations to Clara S., Naya C., Jack D., Lucas V., and Brodie S. and their teacher, Sam Gleeson, for bringing home a $400 prize in the Rocky Mountain Environmental Hazards Challenge\!**

These hard working middle schoolers identified a lack of community flood preparedness at a mobile home park as a significant natural hazard issue affecting their community. The&nbsp;[Poudre Valley Mobile Home Park](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=3448b7a958&amp;e=d44f2694ec){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;is located just outside of the city limits of Fort Collins and may be at more risk of flooding than other communities due to its location in a floodplain and the vulnerable population living there. The Compass students researched Fort Collins and Larimer County flood preparedness policies, reviewed flood preparedness information from government sites including&nbsp;[Ready.Gov](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=c543a3d7c2&amp;e=d44f2694ec){: target="_blank"}, spoke with the mobile home park’s community organization, Mi Voz, and with a representative from&nbsp;[City of Fort Collins’ Floodplain Management office](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=180ab01f76&amp;e=d44f2694ec){: target="_blank"}. Through their research, the students developed a proposal to organize a community flood awareness and preparedness event at the Poudre Valley Mobile Home Park. Their project would bring the community together to learn about their flood risk, things they can do to better prepare themselves and protect their property, and provide information on the benefits of flood insurance.

# Interns Say Farewell

![](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-08-at-1-36-15-pm.png){: width="1000" height="561"}

Nikki and Anna were great interns for us at Compass this semester. They are both Human Development and Family Studies students at CSU and we loved having them learn with us this spring. Their internships, like all of our lives, were severely disrupted by the pandemic shutdowns, but they both persisted and did the best they could to continue to help out with Compass. Nikki has made a&nbsp;[very sweet farewell video](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=b7717ed40c&amp;e=d44f2694ec){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;to all of us in the Compass community. Thanks, Nikki, we will miss you and Anna and wish you all the best in your continuing learning journey\!

# MathCounts Team Wraps Up a Great First Season

Seven Compass middle school students and six Colorado Early Colleges middle school students met up online, along with their teachers, for a friendly MathCounts scrimmage on May 7. Students answered quiz-bowl style math questions, such as "What is the 13th number in the arithmetic sequence 7, 10, 13, … ?", working together on team follow-up questions. This fun crossover event was a nice way to wrap up our MathCounts year\! Our team is now at 3470 problems solved for the year. GO TEAM\!
