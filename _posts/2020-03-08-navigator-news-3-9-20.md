**Compass students won the Global Impact Challenge—and with it—a $5000 award\!&nbsp;**World-class educators from around the country applied to participate in the No Barriers and Wells Fargo project, a diversity and inclusion competition designed to spark the best ideas from students for building a world free of barriers, stereotypes and discrimination. Bonnie, one of our very own world-class educators, won the opportunity to participate.&nbsp;**The students in her Venture wowed the judges by coming up with a proposal to create a mental health curriculum for teens, by teens.&nbsp;**This award means that they can move forward with their project\! In addition to the award, 10 Compass participants won a chance to get a fully paid trip to participate in the 2020 No Barriers Summit in San Francisco in September. The whole school gathered to celebrate—and we couldn't be more proud. Stay tuned for more to come about this exciting project\!

Faculty Restroom Under Siege

&nbsp;

*By Compass Parent Alan Burd*

A cadre of students with cameras and studio quality lighting took over the teacher’s restroom as Compass, today. Confused staff members were seen opening the door to their potty place only to be confronted by students (and faculty) shooting some footage to illustrate issues around climate change. Yep…saving the planet is a priority for Compass students. How exactly did this video illuminate the problem of global climate change? Stay tuned; enquiring minds want to know. Like ME\!
