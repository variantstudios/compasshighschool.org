###### Six Word Memoir: 

"I will fix it for us"

###### What's your educational specialty/background?

I am a Certified Aviation mechanic. I followed my service in the U.S.Marines by attaining my Air frame and Power plant Certificate. I have worked at several local industries as an industrial mechanic. I have been a life long student of all things mechanical, and am currently trying to building an electric car in my garage at home.

###### Why Compass?

The opportunities of a brand new design for teaching/learning has never been more exciting. Dropping the old standards of school learning and breaking into a new model to excite/entice the kids, will be incredible to watch. I am so grateful to be even a small part of this, at this school.

###### Besides your specialty, what other talents and interests do you want to share with our community?

I would hope we could introduce Yoga/Meditation to the students.

###### What previous life experiences are you bringing to the Compass Community?

Being a dad to a 29 year old. Being a good step dad to a 12, and a 6 year old!! Over 10 years of Yoga, and a few years of Meditation practice may help!

###### What is your dream project/partnership at Compass?

Completing my electric car project with the students help! Then using it as a driving billboard/demonstration for CCC School!

###### What do you believe?

This school model is way overdue. I believe it will spread, and change the way we educate our kids at other schools.

###### What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?

I feel like it's still coming!

###### If you could wake up tomorrow with one new quality or ability, what would it be?

Mechanical engineering knowledge/degree, or a Colorado Teachers certificate!

###### For what in your life do you feel the most grateful?

Giving up alcohol and getting out of the craft beer industry!!

###### What would constitute a "Perfect Day"?

Fixing an important issue for the school, keeping us safe and warm for learning.

###### When do you feel at your most creative?

Working on my electric car I am building. There is no pattern to follow.

###### What three skills are most essential to live in these times?

Compassion, Empathy, Determination

###### What place would you most like to travel to if you had to go alone?

One of Colorado's 14'ers - Pike Peak for example.
