Venture Highlight: Independent Venture
{: .cta}

Compass offers students the opportunity to employ entrepreneurial mindsets and use community-engaged project-based learning (venture projects) to inspire deep learning of academic, social-emotional, and 21st Century essential skills. Venture projects may be group-based or individual—especially as students advance to higher levels. Here, three Upper School students share the details of their current Independent Venture and the community members supporting them in their learning\!

**Student: Anna<br>Age:** 14<br>**Problem Statement:** People find microbiology to be a scary and intimidating subject and therefore are unwilling to learn about it.&nbsp;<br>**Community Partners:** [CSU Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=3fe86205cd&amp;e=d44f2694ec)&nbsp;students and Katie Boisen’s 4th grade class at [Zach Elementary&nbsp;](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=2293f9f324&amp;e=d44f2694ec)<br>**Project Findings:** *“Science does not need to be cold, instead it is a discipline filled with curiosity, wonder, and compassion.”*

Why Compass? Parents Speak\!
{: .cta}

*"Our kids have benefited greatly from the teachers and staff at Compass. The teachers put great effort into their plans including outings in the community to interview employees, community members and get a front row experience of businesses that apply to their studies. The information gathered is put to use by creating a piece of work either for their schoolwork or for others to benefit in the greater community. Our kids are excited for school each morning and talk about their fun experiences in learning. In addition, our kids are challenged in their learning and thinking at compass, which supports them becoming engaged participants and contributors to the community as they become young adults." &nbsp;*
