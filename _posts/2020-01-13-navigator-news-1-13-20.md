# Reflections on Presentations of Learning

![](/assets/images/presentation-of-learning-compass-community-collaborative-charter-school.jpg){: width="1600" height="1140"}

***From a Compass parent:***&nbsp;“I wanted to email you and thank you for the great opportunity all the students had to present their Presentations of Learning to their parents and groups.&nbsp; My daughter worked so hard on her presentation - that is the hardest I've seen her work in years. Some of it was motivated by fear of public speaking, and reaching her time limit, and in the end she did a great job and was very proud of herself.&nbsp; Public speaking is hard for most adults, and I'm so impressed with the way the students tackled their fears and embraced this learning assignment. Thanks for pushing them outside of their comfort zones\!” &nbsp;

***From a Compass Board member:***&nbsp;“Thanks for having me sit in on student presentations\! They were all so incredible. I am thankful to be part of such an impactful organization in Fort Collins. Compass is truly making the world a better place.”

***Thanks to all the parents and friends who supported our presenters***

We couldn’t agree more\! The profound reflections and deep learning that we witnessed as our students presented to parents and peers was a window into the powerful impact that Compass is having on the lives of our students. We teach differently, we assess differently, and we have built a culture that cares deeply. The winter Presentations of Learning are just one insight into the ways that our students are learning critical skills that will serve them for the rest of their lives.&nbsp;

Did you miss them, or see only a middle school presentation? Please take the opportunity to see Lucie's POL that she created and presented as a video.&nbsp;[Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPXPWczIPFDT-4wSy57ojdzgPmBaV-J0/view?usp=sharing){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;to see her fun and thoughtful presentation\!

# **Hello\! I'm Hadeel.**

![](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-01-11-at-8-08-25-pm.png){: width="1344" height="826"}

*I discovered my love for teaching when I volunteered at Irish Elementary in high school. I continued volunteering all through college at Beattie Elementary, teaching 5th grade math. I was hired as a math and literacy interventionist at Riffenburgh elementary for a year. In addition, I coached Science Olympiad at Poudre High School for two years. More recently, I worked as an instructor at Mathnasium of Fort Collins and as an AVID Tutor at Wellington Middle school.*

*As an educator, I have many aspirations for my students. My biggest goal is to give every student in my classroom a voice and a space to be heard. I believe that every student can learn if given the right resources and opportunities. Teaching should be student-centered and I want every student to know that they can succeed.*

Hadeel has just joined Compass as a math teacher\! Read her&nbsp;[full bio here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxC4PvDe91O3T0d3eVhFbHoybVFwcWc5dEZQeUlWMm9lWEZF/view?usp=sharing){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;WELCOME Hadeel\!
