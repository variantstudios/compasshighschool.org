In celebration of National LatinX Heritage Month,&nbsp;**a group of students at Compass were able to travel to Colorado State University and participate in this cultural kick-off event.**&nbsp;Our students enjoyed music from a local mariachi band, and ate lunch on the plaza with university students celebrating our heritage.

**National LatinX Heritage Month takes place September 15th to October 15th.**&nbsp;Colorado State University celebrates the month with music, food, and cultural awareness programming. This event validated both CSU and Compass students who identify as Hispanic, Latina/o, Latinx.

Notes from the School Board
{: .cta}

**The Compass School Board is on board with a YES vote for the PSD Mill Levy Override\!**

On Monday, September 16, the Compass Board approved a resolution in support of the Mill Levy Override that the Poudre School District is proposing for the November ballot. We would like you to consider doing the same.

**Why vote for the Mill Levy Override?**

* Colorado ranks among the lowest in the nation in state K-12 funding.
* PSD gets the lowest amount of per-pupil revenue allowed by law.&nbsp;
* For the first time in recent history, PSD’s starting teacher salaries are less than in neighboring communities, such as Loveland and Greeley.
* Compass would receive a portion of the property tax money to support our teachers and staff.
* For more information on the Mill Levy Override, visit:&nbsp;[www.psdschools.org/MLO2019](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=4a96f6d6df&amp;e=d44f2694ec){: target="_blank"}

In speaking with several Fort Collins residents, I’ve noticed a trend. Many people—even those in the real estate industry—are convinced that the increase in their property valuations over recent years has led to more money for PSD. This, unfortunately, is not the case\! Because of the state formula used to distribute property tax money throughout districts across the state, PSD doesn’t see a rise in per-pupil revenue when valuations increase. Indeed, school finance in Colorado is rather complicated\! For more on this issue, see this&nbsp;[Coloradoan article](https://compassfortcollins.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f92353bb4e553c0be87c16d55&amp;id=c5ad12041d&amp;e=d44f2694ec){: target="_blank"}. However, a vote for a Mill Levy Override keeps the local money collected in the district—helping us to ensure that we continue to support and attract our amazingly talented staff and teachers\!

**Looking for Additional Board Members**

The Compass Board is always on the lookout for new potential Board members\! We are specifically interested in creative, talented individuals willing to donate time and energy to making Compass awesome. Currently, we are seeking people with experience in finance, development, law, or marketing/PR. Interested? Know any other community members who would be a good fit? (Being a Compass parent, while ALWAYS welcome, is not a prerequisite for Board membership.) The first step is to reach out to our [Governance Committee](mailto:gina@compassfortcollins.org).
