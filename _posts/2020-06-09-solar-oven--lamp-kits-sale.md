### Makers Kits and Solar Lamps for Sale

This spring, students in the Renewable Energy venture took a leap and launched a student-run business while doing distance learning\!&nbsp;

To bring solar-powered devices to people experiencing homelessness, Compass students are [selling Solar Lamps, Pizza Box Solar Ovens and DIY Solar Lamp Kits](http://shop.meet-ed.org/store/compass-creations). DIY kits and lamps range from $13-16.

**We have products for all ages and ability levels:**

* Younger kids will enjoy the solar oven, which they can use to learn about renewable energy and make delicious treats like nachos and cookies\!
* Older kids will enjoy a learn-to-solder kit or a pre-soldered kit, which allows them to make their own solar lamp and learn how solar energy works.

If you would like to give back to your community, you can order a solar lamp that can be donated to someone in need. We partner with&nbsp;[Homeward Alliance](https://www.homewardalliance.org){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;to deliver solar lights to people experiencing homelessness in our community.

All proceeds from these solar products will benefit our mission:&nbsp;*Help, inspire and teach by providing affordable devices and education about solar energy.&nbsp;*
