# As This School Year Closes, We Look Ahead to Next

![](/assets/images/the-map-is-not-the-journey.jpg){: width="1000" height="751"}

**When we were designing Compass, we set out with the belief that schools should help prepare students for uncertainty.&nbsp;**We knew we wanted to help students develop the tools to weather adversity, to prepare them not only to be resilient, but also to thrive in novel situations.&nbsp;**Wow\! We had no idea what practical application the future had in store.&nbsp;**

To say that the spring of 2020 has been novel would be an understatement. While this was not the scenario any of us envisioned, we are well-equipped to handle this challenge through the design thinking expertise and the loving community we have cultivated in the past two years. The details of next year are not yet determined, however&nbsp;**the DNA of Compass remains strong.**&nbsp;

As we empathize with the myriad of challenges and opportunities presented at this time, we will continue to rely on the collective wisdom of national innovative education experts and our own team of student-centered educators to guide our work. This will likely involve new ideas and opportunities, and&nbsp;**we look forward to continuing to evolve to meet the needs of our families and larger community.**&nbsp;

In designing our learning structure for next school year we will be working with guidance from the Colorado Department of Education, Poudre School District, the Governorâ€™s office, and public health officials to determine the best course of action.&nbsp;**Presently, PSD has set the date of June 30 as the deadline for communicating possible scenarios for the fall**&nbsp;with the Fort Collins community. At that time we will have a better idea of how our fall opening could be impacted.

More than ever, we recognize that education can take many forms and occur in many contexts. We are committed to taking advantage of every opportunity to help our students grow and develop, no matter the constraints.&nbsp;

We wish everyone a safe and enjoyable summer\!

Warmly,<br>The Compass Team

# Welcomes and Farewells

**The good news is that we are proud to welcome our newest team member, Dr. Katherine Zaunbrecher,**&nbsp;who will be joining our math and science team in August. Katherine has a Ph.D. in physics and has been teaching pre-algebra to middle school students and Algebra 2 and physics to high school students for the last three years. She is really excited to unleash her curiosity, creativity, and community connections as part of the Compass Community Collaborative teaching team. Welcome, Katherine\!

**The hard news is that we also have to take this opportunity to wish a fond farewell to both Marty and Hadeel.**&nbsp;They are each moving on to new adventures in their careers. Marty has been an essential team member and doer of all things large and small for the last two years. We could not have opened our school without his generosity, expertise, and commitment to our school. We will miss you, Marty, and we are deeply grateful for all that you have done for us\! Hadeel joined us in January and has been a smart, hard-working, and committed team member. Having grown up in Fort Collins, she is ready to launch her young adult life in a bigger city. We know wherever she lands, she will be successful, and we are grateful for her work with our team and students this semester.

**Another fond farewell goes to Aisezym and Alexandra**, our foreign exchange students from Kyrgyzstan and Spain, respectively. Both girls were outstanding contributors to our Compass community. We will miss them and we hope they will both stay in touch as they create great things in the world\!
