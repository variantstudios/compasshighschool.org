Innovation Takes Money
{: .cta}

<div>We are pleased to announce a matching opportunity that starts now!<a target="_blank" href="http://compassfortcollins.org/giving">&nbsp;</a><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://compassfortcollins.org/giving">Every donation that is given online</a>&nbsp;from today through Giving Tuesday, December 3 will be matched dollar for dollar--up to $5,000.&nbsp;</strong>A huge thanks to Jeff and Lea Curler for sponsoring this generous matching gift.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>100% of our Board of Directors and over 80% of our staff have already given</strong>&mdash;meaning we have already raised over $6,000 towards our $15,000 goal. We need your help to cross the finish line!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>When you&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://compassfortcollins.org/giving">visit our page</a>, you can choose from three campaigns&mdash;<a target="_blank" href="https://compassfortcollins.org/giving?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=30577">The Area of Greatest Need</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://compassfortcollins.org/giving?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=30528">Every Compass Student Needs to Eat</a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://compassfortcollins.org/giving?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=30575">School is the REAL WORLD!</a>&nbsp;If you like, you can spread your gift easily over any of these campaigns with one simple payment. Every dollar will be matched!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Compass strives to push the barriers of traditional education on a daily basis&mdash;but all of this innovation takes money. Colorado currently funds schools over $2,000 less per pupil than the national average. And as a public charter school, we need to make these funds cover not only our world-class staff and cutting-edge programming&mdash;we also have to pay for infrastructure and our building. Every dollar that you give helps us provide the best possible education&mdash;and future preparation--for your students. Please take a moment and DOUBLE your impact today.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>We seek to break down the barriers between school and the "real world," which is why "community" is part of our name. Please spread the word to YOUR community&mdash;you can post a link to our giving page with a simple click onto Facebook. Tell everyone about your gift&mdash;and give them the chance to have theirs matched as well.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thank you for being a part of our vibrant learning community.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Yours Gratefully,</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Jan Harrison</div>

<div>School Leader</div>
