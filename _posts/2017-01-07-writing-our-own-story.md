One of the concepts that sets Compass High School apart is our focus on identity: who we are, where we come from and how we see the world.  Our mission in working with students is clear…

*to help students discover learning with purpose; to author the best possible story of their lives and of our collective future.*

A significant part of our core curriculum will be about storytelling as students explore their identity and personal journey.  As part of this exploration, we will work closely with students to help them write their own story, just as we at Compass High School write ours.  So to begin to understand what makes up all stories, please check out this video illustrating Dan Harmon’s universal theory of storytelling, influenced by Joseph Campbell and his concept of the Hero’s Journey.

As you watch, consider your own journey.  How can we take control of our individual lives and, rather than just be bystanders, write our own story?
