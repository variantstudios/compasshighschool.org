### Staff: Kayla Crowe-Stover

#### Teacher-Adviser: English

#### &nbsp;

###### Six Word Memoir:&nbsp;

*"Feet planted rooted in the moment."*

###### What's your educational specialty/background?

*B.A. English*

###### Why Compass?

*Working on Compass has made me the best version of my teacher self, and continuing to be that person is the best thing I can do for kids.*

###### Besides your specialty, what other talents and interests do you want to share with our community?

*I am a life-long dancer. I enjoy all kinds of dance, specifically modern and lyrical. I also like using my English background to create stories through choreography. Music and movement evoke emotions that can be conveyed thematically through different art forms.*

*I also have a big imagination. I enjoy acting and role playing. Even though I've never played, I would love to learn more about Dungeons & Dragons. I am fascinated by the reemergence of the game and curious about the game's effects on learning.*

*I am a big foodie. Before I was a teacher, I worked in the restaurant industry for many years. I learned a lot about food preparation and waste. After reading Barbra Kingsolver's book Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, I have developed a passion for local and ethical food. I like to learn about where our food comes from and how we can be better about our country's food production and consumption.*

###### What is your dream project/partnership at Compass?

*A project about untold stories. I recently heard a TedTalk about Native American resistant groups, a topic I've always been fascinated about, and the speaker gave a statistic that the highest growing youth population in our country are Native Americans. As I continued to listen, I wept over the silenced stories of these young Americans and I wondered where these silenced stories are in our backyard. Why do we find it difficult asking people to share their stories? For example, military vets, immigrants, the new kid in class. How do relationships change when we reach out and ask about a person's story? When our stories are shared we no longer become invisible, and when other people listen to our stories with compassion change becomes possible.*

###### What do you believe?

*"Live simply, so that others may simply live."- Gandhi*

###### What are five things that you know to be true?

1. *Change is the only constant*
2. *Reading fiction helps you learn to love others*
3. *Humans are wired to create*
4. *One solid friend is worth more than 1000 Facebook likes*
5. *Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars movie, period*

###### What would constitute a "perfect day"?

*A "perfect day" would be spent with my family completely present. To be fully engaged in my children's imaginative play without worrying about what needs to come next. We'd eat when we got hungry and sleep when we got tired. We'd lay under a shady tree or jump in a lake if we got hot. We'd snuggle under blankets and read so many books if we got cold. We'd all pick up an instrument to jam on (even if we don't know how to play) and dance together.*

*The best part about my perfect day is that I've been privileged to have already had so many!*
