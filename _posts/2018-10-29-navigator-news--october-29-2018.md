*Take a peek into the past week's happenings at Compass Community Collaborative School.*

**Club Happenings**

While **Mindful Mondays** isn’t exactly a club, it is one of the ways that we are offering students opportunities at lunch. Last Monday, one of our English teachers, Kayla Crowe-Stover, and one of our student leaders, Mia, led a group in yoga. The WHOLE space was infused with a beautiful sense of calm, and it was really interesting to see who showed up to give yoga a try!

Our math and computer science teacher surprised us all with a treat the other week! She brought a **virtual reality game** in for kids to play with at lunch and the most fun of it all was to watch her play and beat every player in the building! Go, Dawn (she really earned some “street cred” for this!)!

**Community Collaborations**

**Center for the Built Environment **

We have had more opportunities with community partners than we can name in one newsletter, so we will highlight different partners in each newsletter! This week I want to give a shout out to Colin Day who is a professional artist and has a creative “day job” at the Center for the Built Environment at CSU. Colin has been working with a group of students for the last three weeks and will conclude with one final session on collaging. He has worked with students on theme and composition and one week we met him at the Downtown Artery to learn more about the local arts scene and draw some inspiration from the local artists who work there.

**GetWET Observatory **

Another recent seminar involved working with scientists at the GetWET Observatory at CSU. Students walked with Jan to the outdoor lab, just east and north of Compass, to study groundwater and surface water quality and interactions. It was a beautiful day and illuminating science for all!
