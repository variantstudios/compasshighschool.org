# Renewable Energy Venture in Full Swing

![](/assets/images/dawn-put-together-and-handed-out-kits-to-her-venture-students-so-they-have-the-tools-they-need-for-solar-projects.jpg){: width="1600" height="1200"}

The Renewable Energy venture is a hands-on venture project\!&nbsp;**Students have been engaging in the engineering design process by designing, creating, packaging, selling, and distributing solar lamps and solar phone chargers.**

What do you do when your venture requires a makerspace but the makerspace is at school? You send the makerspace to the students\! Last week Dawn packaged 15 supply kits and made a no-contact exchange with families. It was great to wave at the kids and parents through masks and windshields\!&nbsp;

This week the solar lamp, solar charger, and business teams are meeting in small, virtual, groups to begin the Humanity-Centered Design process. Everyone on board is excited about making lives better through solar energy.

# **Parents, Let's ZOOM\!**

**Compass parents, we are planning a Zoom&nbsp;*Perspectives in Parenting*&nbsp;meeting just for you\!&nbsp;**

Join us for a discussion of&nbsp;*Crucial Conversations During Uncertain Times*&nbsp;on Monday, May 4 AND 11 from 7-8pm. &nbsp;We will discuss how to manage your own anxiety and fear while talking to your child about their future. We know you are busy and juggling many differing commitments. We'll use a TedTalk and an ebook to guide our conversation—so there will be minimal time commitment to prepare.&nbsp;

Come relate to others who are wondering the same things you are. Please contact Wendy to confirm your interest and receive the Zoom link to join.&nbsp;
