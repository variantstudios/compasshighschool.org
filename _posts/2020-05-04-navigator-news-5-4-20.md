# Thank You Teachers\!

This week is teacher appreciation week across the nation. Never before have we seen more clearly the essential nature of the teaching profession. Equally as well, families see now in stark relief the challenge of what it takes to provide engaging, relevant, and rigorous learning opportunities for diverse learners day after day. This work is not for the faint of heart\!

All teachers are heroes, and Compass teachers are the most creative, committed, innovative, and hard-working teacher heroes I have ever had the pleasure with whom to work. They are the courageous, community-engaged design-thinkers that we are supporting all of our students to become. They model the social emotional intelligence and learner skills that we value and teach every day, whether we are in school together or spread out across the city working remotely. The way they have worked with me since before we opened was notable, but the way they have stepped up to the challenges of education in a pandemic is truly awe-inspiring. I am humbled to be the leader of this exceptional team of educators, and I know that all of our families and students are equally grateful for their selfless contributions to our next generation of positive change makers\!

Stay Well,<br>Jan

Students enjoyed having Compass student Minecraft time last week, so Dawn will continue hosting games each Wednesday and Saturday. This past Saturday, students recreated the Compass building in Minecraft, complete with brick walls, gallery, pods and more\!&nbsp;

***In Sam's science class, an assignment for middle schoolers last week was to create a model of a virus. They then had to present a written report or video \*\*explaining\*\* the virus they researched. This is what the Ebola&nbsp;******virus \*\*looks\*\* like—in case you were wondering.***
