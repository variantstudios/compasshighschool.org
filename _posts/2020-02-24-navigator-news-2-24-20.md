# Helping Our Global Community

![](/assets/images/1000-img-2883.jpg){: width="1000" height="750"}

**Compass students raised over $1,000 for&nbsp;[*Feed My Starving Children*](https://www.fmsc.org/){: target="_blank"}, a non-profit that packages food for malnourished children in over 70 countries.&nbsp;**

If that were not enough, the 11th grade Futures venture participated in PACKAGING that food at the&nbsp;[*Slammin Famine*](https://slamminfamine.org)&nbsp;event at the Budweiser Events Center on February 21\! Students helped package meals—assembly line fashion—and managed to have a lot of fun while doing it. Helping the community + bonding + rocking the hair nets = Friday at Compass\!

**Malachai, Sarah, Lucas, and John said of the experience:&nbsp;***“Volunteering to pack meals for Feed my Starving Children was really rewarding. When Katie first brought up the idea we didn't really know what we were getting into, but it was a really nice experience. It was great to see the school come together to raise money for a good cause. It was also incredible to see a full warehouse of people working to feed the world. They played music and made it a fun experience for all of us; we danced so much\! And we got hairnets\! We got to raise enough money for 4,000 meals and packed over 7,000 meals. John also found his true calling as a lunch lady\!”&nbsp;*

*“Through this experience, we packed 34 boxes which is equivalent to 7,000 meals for children across the world. We felt a strong sense of community as we pushed towards the same goal of helping the cause in any way we could. By donating and volunteering an opportunity that Compass staff has given us, we were given perspective on our privilege and how much involvement matters. We would like to thank you for giving us the gift of being able to go out of school and help something larger than ourselves.”*&nbsp;**Maya, Raine, and Gabi**

# Learning Doesn't Just Happen "At School"

Here are great ways to engage students in learning outside of the classroom.

**ENGLISH**

* Write about anything you want for 10 minutes a day. Try it for two weeks and see how your writing changes. Look for ways to add more details in your writing and seek to make sentence structure varied and interesting.
* Read anything you like for 20 minutes a day. It will strengthen your skill as a reader and writer and build your vocabulary\!

**MATH**

* Look for data around you. What can you conclude?&nbsp;&nbsp;
* Attempt to quantify things around you by estimating, counting, and adding and subtracting “in your head”.&nbsp;

**SCIENCE**

* Ask a ton of deep questions&nbsp; “What are the potential consequences of…”&nbsp;&nbsp;
* Watch youtube videos on science:&nbsp;[Scishow](https://www.youtube.com/user/scishow){: target="_blank"},&nbsp;[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/){: target="_blank"},&nbsp;[Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q){: target="_blank"}are all great
* Read studies in the news and evaluate their quality, sample size, method, replication?

**SOCIAL STUDIES**

* Read/watch the news and talk about it
* Consider the relevance of global events locally and vice versa&nbsp;
* Get involved in local civic issues

**SPANISH**

* Get the&nbsp;[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;app (or other free language development apps) and practice for 15 minutes a day
* Watch a favorite show or read a favorite book in Spanish. Not ready yet? Just put on Spanish subtitles on your favorite shows\!
