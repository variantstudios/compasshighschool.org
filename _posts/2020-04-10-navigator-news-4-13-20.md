# The Compass Culture Challenge

We had great submissions for last week's challenges of creating 1) an obstacle course and/or 2) a music play list.&nbsp;

***Emerson (my sister) and I, took part in the weekly Compass Culture Challenge with a little bit of a twist. Instead of making an obstacle course we went over to our grandparents house, and of course kept our social distance (6 ft apart), and chalked their whole front driveway. We hope that when older folks in their neighborhood walk by, they can see some artwork that would hopefully put a smile on their face, and de-stress from the current world situation. We also did some art in our front driveway in hopes of the same outcome.***

***Huxley and Hadley both drew a prototype before drawing in the street. We have also had several neighbors completing the course. My favorite part is the course takes participants to my free little library to grab a book and then they have to crab walk with the book on their bellies before finishing\!***
