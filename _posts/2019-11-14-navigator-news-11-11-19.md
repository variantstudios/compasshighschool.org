Bonnie, Shamayim, and Jason took nearly 40 students to CSU to hear speaker [Attorney General Weiser](https://coag.gov) on election day.&nbsp;**He spoke about the importance of staying positive and involved in government policy, even when politics are frustrating and divisive. It was really inspirational\!**&nbsp;We were the only high school (with a few middle schoolers, too) there amongst a few hundred CSU students and staff, diverse community members, and other Colorado politicians. Our students were engaged and three students had the courage to speak publically and asked well thought out and articulated direct questions to Weiser—as did our very own Shamayim\! We were all so proud of them\! We love it when community, especially the youth, are active in political discussion and awareness.&nbsp;

Sam Houghteling, the [Director of the Straayer Center for Public Service](https://www.libarts.colostate.edu/areas/straayer-center-public-service-leadership/) Leadership is a long time supporter of Compass and he had reached out directly to Jan to&nbsp; invite our students and teachers to join the event. Afterwards, he met with several students and it sparked conversations of possible internships at the Straayer Center.&nbsp;**Exciting connections are being made every day at Compass\!**
