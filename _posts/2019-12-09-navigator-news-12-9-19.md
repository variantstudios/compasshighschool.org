**The City of Fort Collins Human Relations Council awarded Compass a 2019 Human Relations Award.**&nbsp;Every year the Human Relations Award recognizes those in our community who promote acceptance and respect for diversity in the City of Fort Collins. Our school was nominated by a current student who wrote about the strength and safety she feels within the Compass culture. The ceremony was led by commission representatives and Mayor Wade Troxell. It was a beautiful and humbling celebration of what we have created together\!

[Dr. Amanda Stronza](https://rpts.tamu.edu/people/stronza-dr-amanda/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;led a whole-school assembly to share her work with EcoExist, a nonprofit working in Botswana to help elephants and humans coexist. Botswana is one of the only places in the world where elephant populations are not being decimated.&nbsp;**Her work exemplifies humanity-centered design (HCD), the same process of learning and creating that Compass teaches and practices.**&nbsp;It was great for the kids to see HCD in real world applications solving complex and urgent problems around the world.
