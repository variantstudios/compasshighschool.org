What an exciting time of year! The trees and grass are bright green (just like the paint job on our building!), the end of another school year is just a few days away, and the opening of our inaugural year at Compass Community Collaborative School is just a couple of months away!

I want to take this opportunity to let you all know how grateful we are for all of the support and hard work you have shared with us to get us to this momentous place. &nbsp;We have surpassed our baseline registration targets (additional students are registering everyday so we continue to get closer to our maximum first year cap), our building remodeling is well underway and on-schedule for opening, and our staff is officially in place. &nbsp;As we now are finalizing the hiring of our last positions for next year, we are more driven than ever to open our doors. Thank you all for believing in us, supporting our development and working hard with us to meet all of these goals. We feel so fortunate to have such a passionate and active community of families, businesses and community partners!

We have finalized our submissions to the district and have been given the final greenlight from the Board of Education. &nbsp;We’ve met all of the deadlines and conditions for opening with flying colors. Next, our organizational structures come online to streamline our community communication and help make the rest of the summer’s work go as smoothly and efficiently as possible. We will spend the summer months strengthening our community partnerships, &nbsp;developing curriculum, taking part in numerous professional development opportunities around the country and putting the final touches on 2105 S. College Ave.

Stay tuned. &nbsp;We will have another “sneak peek” of the building in August before the first day of school (August 22nd), and there are lots of fun get togethers planned by our dynamic and ever-growing Parent Action Council throughout the summer months. The official opening of Compass Community Collaborative isn’t far away. &nbsp;We are excited. Can you tell?

Jan Harrison, School Leader, and the Compass Team
