# Compass Tech Team Open for Business

Over the summer, the Compass Tech Team has been working hard to inventory, clean, re-image and repair all of the computers in our school—as well as fix things like vacuum cleaners and 3-D printers\!&nbsp;

Seventh grader, Jaden G., courageously tried his hand at a ChromeBook repair the other day, and team leader Karen sent him this email:

*“The computer you completely took apart and rebuilt today is now working\! The new mousepad and keyboard are operating perfectly. Congratulations on your first repair\!\!\!&nbsp; :) I hope that was a fun project\!”&nbsp;*

Thanks for all of your hard work, Jaden\! And Karen, thank you for your support and for engaging students in entrepreneurial pursuits at a young age. That's real-world learning\!
