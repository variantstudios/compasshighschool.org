Thank you Pamela and parent Kristy Moreno for coordinating last week's screenings of the documentary Screenagers. We had a good turnout for the viewing of this eye-opening film and were reminded to consider the **value** of what we, and our children, watch and engage in on electronic devices.

**My name is Déja and I’m one of the CSU interns here at Compass this semester.** I am super excited and honored to be a part of this intelligent community! I’d have to say my favorite part about being here is watching everyone, from students to admin, get passionate about the projects that they invest in. It sparks a sense of motivation in myself to follow the things that I love being a part of and it’s just amazing seeing how much support everyone has for each other!
