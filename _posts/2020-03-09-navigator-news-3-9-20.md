**Compass students won the Global Impact Challenge—and with it—a $5000 award\!&nbsp;**World-class educators from around the country applied to participate in the No Barriers and Wells Fargo project, a diversity and inclusion competition designed to spark the best ideas from students for building a world free of barriers, stereotypes and discrimination. Bonnie, one of our very own world-class educators, won the opportunity to participate.&nbsp;**The students in her Venture wowed the judges by coming up with a proposal to create a mental health curriculum for teens, by teens.&nbsp;**This award means that they can move forward with their project\! In addition to the award, 10 Compass participants won a chance to get a fully paid trip to participate in the 2020 No Barriers Summit in San Francisco in September. The whole school gathered to celebrate—and we couldn't be more proud. Stay tuned for more to come about this exciting project\!

***Students invaded the Compass Community Collaborative School's faculty restroom\!***

*By Compass Parent Alan Burd*

A cadre of students with cameras and studio quality lighting took over the teacher’s restroom as Compass, today. Confused staff members were seen opening the door to their potty place only to be confronted by students (and faculty) shooting some footage to illustrate issues around climate change. Yep…saving the planet is a priority for Compass students. How exactly did this video illuminate the problem of global climate change? Stay tuned; enquiring minds want to know. Like ME\!

# COVID-19 Response

Like all schools in Colorado and across the nation, we are closely monitoring the outbreak of the highly contagious Corona Virus. We are in close communication with the school district, Larimer County Health Department, and the Colorado Department of Education. We recently passed our annual health inspection with flying colors, and we monitor our absenteeism rate daily. Our school nurse, Ann Burkett, is regularly checking in with us and is keeping us apprised as the outbreak develops.&nbsp;

While we are hopeful that we will not have to take the drastic step of closing school for any period of time, we are making plans for this contingency. If the district or county health department recommends school closures, we will close Compass’ campus and implement a remote learning program. We will do our best to ensure that all students have access to a computer and wifi in order to facilitate this online learning environment.

We are continuing to practice excellent cleaning and disinfecting protocols daily, and we are grateful to have our families as partners in keeping us healthy and safe.**Prevention Measures to Practice at Home**Parents and guardians can help prevent illness by continuing with the same critical practices – for themselves and with their children – as one would during flu season.

* Wash hands often with soap and water
* Cover coughs and sneezes
* Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects
* **Keep kids home if they are sick. Please notify Compass if your child is sick and needs to stay home. If possible, please share their symptoms and if they have a positive influenza or Corona Virus diagnosis.**

We recommend that you and your family monitor the situation and check the following websites for updates:

* [Larimer County Health Department](https://www.larimer.org/health/communicable-disease/coronavirus-covid-19){: target="_blank"}
* [Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html){: target="_blank"}
