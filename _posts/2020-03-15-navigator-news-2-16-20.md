# Exhibition of Learning

***![](/assets/images/busy-presenters-and-visitors-in-dawn-s-coding-venture.jpg){: width="1333" height="857"}Busy presenters and visitors in Dawn's venture.***

Thank you all who came to last week's Exhibition of Learning. It means so much to our students and staff to have you join them in celebrating their accomplishments and the completion of projects they have poured their time and energy into over the quarter.

# **Calls to Action from the Climate Films Venture**

&nbsp;

**Call to Action:**

The decisions you make now will affect generations to come. Every trip in the car you take, every water faucet you turn on will have detrimental consequences on all of the life on earth. Be aware of your own habits and educate others on what they can do to reduce their environmental impact.&nbsp;

**Did You Know:**

1. On average, we use 80 gallons of water a day
2. 4\.6 metric tons of CO2&nbsp; is emitted per year by a typical passenger vehicle.&nbsp;
3. The average person throws away 5.5 pounds of trash each day with 1.4 pounds being recycled

**What You Can Do:**

1. If you cut your shower by 2 minutes you will save at least 10 gallons of water
2. Taking public transportation will lower your CO2 emissions by 33%
3. If you compost food scraps that would have been thrown away, you will save up to the equivalent of 33 million car emissions each year.&nbsp;

# **Less Plastic is Better**

***Compass Community Collaborative students are saving the planet … by refilling their water bottles.***

Hydration is incredibly important to our health. Staying hydrated helps clean our bodies of waste, avoiding toxic buildup, and has even been shown to support our brain function and mental health. Helping students to stay hydrated while at school is one way to ensure they are ready to learn. However, there is also reason to be concerned with the amount of plastic being thrown in our landfills.&nbsp;**Worldwide we are currently throwing away 1million plastic bottles…per minute\!&nbsp;**The problem is huge and students at Compass Collaborative Community School are on it.&nbsp;

**Compass students have saved over 30,000 single use plastic bottles from going into our local landfill by using a unique water fountain.&nbsp;**Students place an empty bottle in front of a sensor built into a “regular” water fountain – you can still push a button and drink without a bottle, if you’re into that – and a nozzle situated above the open bottle dispenses a stream of clean, cold water. The fountain has the added bonus of keeping track of how many plastic bottles are being saved\! And students use it. In the 30 minutes since snapping the accompanying picture, the number of bottles saved climbed from 30394 to 30409. That’s 15 bottles saved by students refilling their containers over half an hour. Compass Community Collaborative School is modeling behavior for a better tomorrow. With this kind of leadership, perhaps every water fountain in Fort Collins will soon be equipped with this easy to use, and informative, planet saving technology.
