    - question: 'What is a charter school and how is it different than a private or other public school?'
      answer_html: 'Charter schools are public schools. There is no tuition required. Charter schools are authorized and overseen by the State or a local District school board, but they have their own Board of Directors. Like other charter schools in Fort Collins, we will have a lottery for admission.'

    answer_html: 'Yes, Compass High School will have highly qualified, Colorado certified teachers in English, Math, Science, Social Studies, Special Education, and English Language Acquisition. We will also have specialized, non-certified teachers as staff and instructors at our school and in the community to widen the diversity of adults with whom students and staff may collaborate and learn. For example, our kitchen manager will be an experienced chef and kitchen manager who will work with students to learn about cooking, nutrition, and other life skills.'

    - question: 'Why is Compass using a different model for assessing and transcripting student work?'
    answer_html: 'In our rapidly changing world, we believe that equipping students with the skills to be lifelong learners and positive change-makers is our number one job. Students will learn Colorado core content standards with the help of certified, highly-qualified teachers. However, they will learn these standards at different times, in a multitude of ways, throughout their years at Compass High School.In order to keep students from focusing on grades instead of learning, they will build a professional portfolio of their learning products and earn degrees inside eight, skill-focused digital badges while they are working at Compass High School. Ultimately, academic work will be assigned grades based on competency levels attained so that students will have transcripts for other schools, but this is not the form of feedback we will use as students demonstrate their learning.'    
    - question: 'What standardized assessments will Compass students take?'
    answer_html: 'Compass students will take all state required standardized assessments, including the SAT college entrance exam. In order to track academic growth, students will also be assessed three times a year in reading and mathematics using nationally standardized MAPS tests.'
