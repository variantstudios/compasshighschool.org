  position: CSU Student
  bio: 'As a Fort Collins native, I have grown up surrounded by the beauty of Colorado, the kindness of its people, and the displays of creativity that line our streets and fill our air. Throughout my time in school here, I have crossed paths with many kind, creative people. They have inspired me to join the Compass team. Friends both young and old, student and educator, native and newcomer, have taught me the importance of diverse perspectives. And it will take every perspective we can get to make Compass the beautiful place I know it can be. As a current student at Colorado State University, I hope to use the insight of my friends and peers, as well as my own experiences, to inform and motivate my contribution to Compass. It is with the interests of the students and their futures that I dedicate my work to creating something that is meant for them.'

- name: 'Katie Malone, M.Ed'
  position: High School Science Teacher
  bio: 'Having been in education for 12 years, I take my teaching philosophy from my ecology background: All of our destinies are intertwined and, as such, we all play a role in creating our best possible future.  I have extensive experience in a variety of educational programs, from outdoor education, special education, AVID and Discovery to the International Baccalaureate Program, both Middle Years and Diploma.  This work has pushed me to believe that all students are brilliant- they just need an atmosphere and community that recognizes that.  Over the past few years, in designing and teaching Project-based Learning science courses, I’ve come to realize that it’s time for educators to change their perspective and begin to help kids find their voice and passions.  We are all stronger when our students are empowered to be active citizens in their community and pushed to realize their potential, both as students and teachers.  That is our purpose at Compass High School.'

  bio: 'I have worked as an educator in wide variety of roles including an English teacher in Japan, an elementary teacher on the Zuni reservation, a secondary media and technology integration specialist and a university instructor. Over the years, I have developed a passion for project-based learning and work to provide new teachers with new models of teaching and learning that focus on engagement and shift the focus to students and asks them to be responsible for their own learning.
