I have three master’s degrees, two in science and one in Educational Leadership, as well as a principal’s license. I have \_been a dedicated public educator for fourteen years in Fort Collins, serving as a high school classroom teacher, a department leader, a Dean of Students, and as a district-wide high school interventions facilitator.I became a teacher to change the world. What better way to create a more just and humane planet for all of us than to help orchestrate a rich learning ecosystem that inspires creativity, develops intellect, and fosters compassionate action around the globe?

  bio: "As a public educator in Fort Collins for the past eighteen years, I’ve always been focused on not just my students’ learning, but my own. I believe that the best teachers are also lifelong students, which is one of the reasons I’m drawn to the work we are doing at Compass Community Collaborative School. I’ve worked as an International Baccalaureate Program Coordinator for the past decade as well as an IB Workshop Leader, Consultant and Program Evaluator working with schools all over North America. My collaborative spirit and desire for learning has also led to my work with the Colorado State University Writing Project, a professional organization of teachers working to improve writing and communication skills in K-12 students on the Front Range. This has reinforced my desire to break down walls of traditional discrete subject courses (science, math, history, etc.) and help kids see that education is greater and more powerful than what they often learn in the traditional classroom. Yet no experience has had a greater impact on my view of education than my work as a teacher of high school epistemology – the study of knowledge – for the past decade. \_Leading students through this course helped solidify my understanding of the power of self in the learning process. To understand the world around you, it is first important to understand yourself; how your personal experiences and beliefs impact the way you see and interpret your world. This honoring of identity and the power of each individual student is at the center of my teaching philosophy and our work at Compass."

    I have been a teacher in Fort Collins for four years. Over the last three
    years I have worked to bring more opportunities to my students by creating
    projects such as bringing in CSU ecology students to mentor students on an
    authentic ecology research project, launching weather balloons, engineering
    devices to clean unsafe water, and building electrical power generators. I
    have searched out a variety of roles outside of the classroom to continue
    building positive relationships with students. I have been a soccer coach, a
    club sponsor, and last year I coordinated a trip with students to the
    Galapagos and Ecuador. I look forward to continuing my learning and my
    travels with students at Compass by organizing international trips, outdoor
    excursions and other exciting, immersive experiences for our students. Last
    summer I was able to teach the prototype for Compass with a terrific group
    of kids. The process of teaching students about climate change, writing and
    the art of filmmaking was great fun and very affirming of our educational
    model. I believe that students need a place where they not only are having
    authentic, personally engaging experiences, but where their voices matter
    and they feel like they belong; I look forward to creating that culture at
    Compass Community Collaborative School.

    I was fortunate to be hired for an English teacher position in Poudre School
    District immediately after completing my bachelors degree at Colorado State
    University. Being a young teacher was both challenging and rewarding, but
    what I discovered early on in my career was that I had something to learn
    from every student I taught. Each student’s unique story became a part of my
    own story as we built relationships together. Now, twelve years later I have
    interacted with students in a variety of different settings: as an
    International Baccalaureate and general education teacher, as a coach and
    dance teacher, as a theater choreographer, as a sponsor for poetry and
    service clubs, as a Compass summer prototype teacher. In that time, I also
    become a parent to two remarkable children. In each of these diverse
    settings, I realized that kids want to tell their stories in one form or
    another. As teachers, we have the privilege to be co-creators in these
    narratives, and our responsibility is to learn to listen carefully and
    compassionately to our youth. With this idea in mind, I am passionate about
    fostering opportunities for ALL people to find their voice, and what better
    vehicle than through teaching the craft of writing? As a CCC teacher, I am
    dedicated to researching and implementing the best methods to help students
    find their voices. My current Masters in English thesis digs deeper into how
    we can best support students to voice their ideas and help shape these ideas
    into realities. I look forward to listening, working, collaborating, and
    ultimately building relationships with the future students of Compass
    Community Collaborative.

    After graduating from Kent State University, I moved to Colorado to fulfill
    a year-long volunteer service commitment.  Ultimately, I was hired to
    develop an adolescent program for a homeless shelter, and it was in that
    role of teen advocate and school liaison that I decided I wanted to be a
    teacher. I saw first-hand that having an adult who believed in them was
    essential to positively changing the trajectory of children’s lives. 
    Equally important,  I wanted to inspire in children a desire to learn.  As a
    result, I earned a Post-Bachelor’s Teaching Certificate in Secondary
    Education and a Masters of Education in Instructional Leadership from
    Colorado State University. I spent the next 15 years teaching social
    studies, and while I taught core courses (American History, World History,
    Civics, Sociology), I spent the majority of my career teaching both Advanced
    Psychology and International Baccalaureate Psychology.  I served as Exam
    Reader/Grader for the The College Board and Examiner/Moderator for the
    International Baccalaureate World School and was the recipient of Poudre
    School District’s Excellence in Education Award.  My entrepreneurial spirit
    led me to start my own business and most recently be a project coordinator
    in Larimer County connecting systems for young children’s social-emotional
    development.  Now, I am quite excited to return to where my main passion
    lies, teaching. I am dedicated to Compass Community Collaborative School’s
    mission and trust that our student-centered, meta-learning approach to
    education is the most powerful way we can support students in becoming their

    Having been in education for 12 years, I take my teaching philosophy from my
    ecology background: All of our destinies are intertwined and, as such, we
    all play a role in creating our best possible future.  I have extensive
    experience in a variety of educational programs, from outdoor education,
    special education, AVID and Discovery to the International Baccalaureate
    Program, both Middle Years and Diploma.  This work has pushed me to believe
    that all students are brilliant- they just need an atmosphere and community
    that recognizes that.  Over the past few years, in designing and teaching
    Project-based Learning science courses, I’ve come to realize that it’s time
    for educators to change their perspective and begin to help kids find their
    voice and passions.  We are all stronger when our students are empowered to
    be active citizens in their community and pushed to realize their potential,
    both as students and teachers.  That is our purpose at Compass Community

    I unexpectedly found my calling as an educator on a trip I took to China in
    1998 shortly after receiving my bachelor’s degree in Humanities from
    CU-Boulder.  Armed only with my intuition and enthusiasm, I developed a
    two-week English immersion camp for Chinese teens driven solely by their
    curiosity about American English and culture.  My love of languages,
    curiosity about other cultures, and passion for kids led me to pursue a
    teaching certificate and to specialize in English language acquisition.  In
    addition to serving as both a middle and high school teacher, I have held
    the role of Spanish interpreter, student and family advocate, curriculum
    trainer, language program specialist, witty husband, and human jungle gym
    (father).  I have also partnered with both the University of Northern
    Colorado and Colorado State University education schools to help content
    teachers effectively meet the needs of linguistically diverse students. 
    Once I began teaching and co-teaching Language Arts classes, I realized that
    the language scaffolds and differentiation strategies I had been utilizing
    with my ELD students also made learning more accessible for all my
    students.  I have always endeavored to be a steadfast advocate for student
    equity, and I will no longer stand by to watch any student be denied an
    opportunity due to a test score or a label.  CCC models true integration by
    encouraging students to authentically connect and collaborate across
    different age and ability levels.   Our school is dedicated not only to

    ambassadors for our community who are prepared for the unexpected challenges

    ten years I worked with these incredible individuals and it changed my life.
    I learned how to be patient and practice gratitude in every endeavor in my

    families don’t fall through the cracks. I am excited to see how our team
    teaching and venture project model can benefit from my experience in special

    students and teachers, and to make this school an incredible opportunity for
    growth. I have been an active member in the community and can help build
    bridges with professional organizations and creative individuals. I believe
    that students deserve to be heard and the ability to study what interests
    them. Students should enjoy going to school everyday instead of dreading it.

    I was born and raised in Fort Collins, Colorado. As a first-generation
    Latino male, I learned first hand the struggles of succeeding in the current
    educational system. Although I excelled academically, I found that the
    coursework and structure of the classroom prevented me from reaching my full
    potential, in addition I did not feel an investment in my future from my
    teachers. Rather than dropping out, I decided to enroll into a local
    “alternative” high school called Centennial. This school and teachers
    created an environment where I truly felt valued, revitalizing my desire to
    learn and grow. Due to the influence of Centennial High School, I can say
    that I am a college graduate. In May 2018 I graduated from Colorado State
    University with a Bachelor of Science in Early Childhood Education. Although
    my education has a focus on children, many of the lessons I have learned can
    serve any learner. For example, I believe in “not stealing a student’s
    struggle.” Although I will wholeheartedly support each student individually,
    I plan to do so in a way that guides them towards success and growth which
    often includes overcoming obstacles. I also have a great amount of
    experience working in the community, specifically with underserved students.
    As a child, I was a participant in after-school and summer school
    programming through the local Northside Aztlan Community Center. In my
    teenage years, I was hired on as a support staff in the same programs I was
    raised in. 15+ years later, my passion for creating opportunities for all
    students has only grown and I am excited to continue to teach and learn at
    Compass Community Collaborative School.

    I received my Master’s Degree in Teaching and English Education from
    Teachers College, Columbia University, and taught at multiple levels of both
    middle and high school, in New York and New Jersey, before our family made
    the move to Colorado. Holistically, my time at Columbia as student, teacher,
    curriculum-geek, and all-round education enthusiast, refined my educational
    philosophy and shaped my vision of education in the 21st century. I believe
    scholarship must be accessible to students of every background, ability,
    learning style, and modality. I believe excellence in education is based on
    maintaining a balance among academic rigor, creativity, and plain old fun-
    through which the urge to inquire about our world and delve into
    self-discovery is nurtured and valued. I believe in dynamic, experiential,
    and interdependent learning that fosters solid relationships among students
    and their peers as well as with teachers, the local community, and the
    greater society at large. The educational culture and approaches to
    curriculum that we are crafting at Compass will enact these beliefs. Sir Ken
    Robinson put it best when he wrote, “We have to recognize that human
    flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you
    cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a
    farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish.”
    Compass Community Collaborative school is a ripe and fertile landscape to
    nurture the growth of the students of Fort Collins, and will undoubtedly
    become the benchmark model for educational innovation nationwide.
